When you lift heavy computer towers, printers, servers and more, make sure that you bend your knees when you lift heavy objects to avoid injuring your back. Make sure that as we work inside of a computer case, that any sharp objects should be covered with tape. And while we work it's very important to wear safety goggles to prevent damage to your eyesight.
For your own safety, you should never open a power supply or a monitor that has a built-in power supply. 
 
# Electrical
Follow electrical safety guidelines to prevent electrical fires, injuries, and fatalities.

Some printer parts, such as power supplies, contain high voltage. Check the printer manual for the location of high-voltage components. Some components retain a high voltage even after the printer is turned off.

Electrical devices have certain power requirements. For example, AC adapters are manufactured for specific laptops. Exchanging AC adapters with a different type of laptop or device may cause damage to both the AC adapter and the laptop.

Electric equipment must be grounded. If a fault causes metal parts of the equipment to become live with electrical current, the ground will provide a path of least resistance for the current to flow harmlessly away. Typically computer product connect to ground via the power plug. Large equipment such as server racks that house network devices must also be grounded.

## Electrostatic Discharge
 [ESD] can occur when there is a buildup of an electric charge (static electricity) that exists on a surface which comes into contact with another, differently charged surface. ESD can cause damage to computer equipment if not discharged properly. Follow proper handling guidelines, be aware of environmental issues, and use equipment that stabilizes power to prevent equipment damage and data loss.

At least 3,000 volts of static electricity must build up before a person can feel ESD. For example, static electricity can build up on you as you walk across a carpeted floor. When you touch another person, you both receive a shock. If the discharge causes pain or makes a noise, the charge was probably above 10,000 volts. By comparison, less than 30 volts of static electricity can damage a computer component. Static buildup can be discharged by touching a grounded object prior to touching any electronic equipment. This is known as self-grounding

ESD can cause permanent damage to electrical components. Follow these recommendations to help prevent ESD damage:
- Keep all components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
- Use grounded mats on workbenches.
- Use grounded floor mats in work areas.
- Use antistatic wrist straps when working inside computers.
- Remove jewelry

## Wattage and Voltage
Power supply specifications are typically expressed in watts (W). To understand what a watt is, refer to the interactive image which describes the four basic units of electricity that a computer technician must know.

### Voltage (V)
measured in Volts (V)
- This is a measure of work required to move a charge from one location to another.
- A computer power supply usually produces several different voltages.

### Resistance (R)
**measured in Ohms (â„¦)**
- This refers to the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit.
- Lower resistance allows more current to flow through a circuit.
- A good fuse has low resistance or almost 0 ohms.

### Current (I)
**measured in Amperes, or Amps (A)**
- This is a measure of the amount of electrons moving through a circuit per second.
- Computer power supplies deliver different amperages for each output voltage.

### Power (P)
**measured in Watts (W)**
- This is a measure of the work required to move electrons through a circuit (voltage), multiplied by the number of electrons going through that circuit per second (current).
- Computer power supplies are rated in watts.

## Ohm's Law
A basic equation, known as Ohm's Law, expresses how voltage is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance: **V = IR**. In an electrical system, power is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current: **P = VI**.

## Power Fluctuation
Voltage is a measure of energy required to move a charge from one location to another. The movement of electrons is called current. Computer circuits need voltage and current to operate electronic components. When the voltage in a computer is not accurate or steady, computer components might not operate correctly. Unsteady voltages are called power fluctuations. 

The following types of AC power fluctuations can cause data loss or hardware failure:
- **Blackout** - Complete loss of AC power. A blown fuse, damaged transformer, or downed power line can cause a blackout.
- **Brownout** - Reduced voltage level of AC power that lasts for a period of time. Brownouts occur when the power line voltage drops below 80 percent of the normal voltage level and when electrical circuits are overloaded.
- **Noise** - Interference from generators and lightning. Noise results in poor quality power, which can cause errors in a computer system.
- **Spike** - Sudden increase in voltage that lasts for a short period and exceeds 100 percent of the normal voltage on a line. Spikes can be caused by lightning strikes, but can also occur when the electrical system comes back on after a blackout.
- **Power surge** - Dramatic increase in voltage above the normal flow of electrical current. A power surge lasts for a few nanoseconds, or one-billionth of a second.

## Power Protection Devices
To help shield against power fluctuation problems, use devices to protect the data and computer equipment:

- **Surge protector** - Helps protect against damage from surges and spikes. A surge suppressor diverts extra electrical voltage that is on the line to the ground. The amount of protection offered by a surge protector is measured in joules. The higher the joule rating, the more energy over time the surge protector can absorb. Once the number of joules is reached, the surge protector no longer provides protection and will need to be replaced.

- **Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)** - Helps protect against potential electrical power problems by supplying a consistent level of electrical power to a computer or other device. The battery is constantly recharging while the UPS is in use. The UPS provides a consistent quality of power when brownouts and blackouts occur. Many UPS devices can communicate directly with the computer operating system. This communication allows the UPS to safely shut down the computer and save data prior to the UPS losing all battery power.

- **Standby power supply (SPS)** - Helps protect against potential electrical power problems by providing a backup battery to supply power when the incoming voltage drops below the normal level. The battery is on standby during normal operation. When the voltage decreases, the battery provides DC power to a power inverter, which converts it to AC power for the computer. This device is not as reliable as a UPS because of the time it takes to switch over to the battery. If the switching device fails, the battery cannot supply power to the computer.

**CAUTION**: UPS manufacturers suggest never plugging a laser printer into a UPS because the printer could overload the UPS.

# Fire
Guidelines in order to avoid cuts, burns, electrical shock and damage to your eyesight.
- remove any watches or jewelry and also secure our loose clothing
- turn off and unplug any equipment before we work on it. 
- keep food and drinks and any clutter out of our workspace.

As we work with electrical and dangerous components, you never know when something might catch fire. You should always know where the closest fire extinguisher is and also how to use it.
As we discuss fire safety, it's important that you remember to never fight a fire that is out of control or not contained. You should make sure you know how to get out of the building quickly that you are in. And don't forget to contact emergency services for help. Make sure you're prepared. You should locate and read instructions on any fire extinguisher near your workspace before you use them. Also you should make sure that the fire extinguisher is going to work.

Now a fire can spread very quickly and also be very costly. You should know the basics of using a fire extinguisher to prevent a small fire
from getting out of control.
The word you have to remember is pass. 
- P stands for pull the pin. 
- A stands for aim at the base of the fire. Not at the flames. 
- S stands for squeeze the lever. 
- S stands for sweep the nozzle from side to side.

You should be familiar with the different types of fire extinguishers. Some fire extinguishers, they're actually designed for paper, wood, plastics and cardboard. While others are designed for electrical equipment or even gasoline or combustible metals. This fire extinguisher here is rated for a couple items. It's rated for trash,wood and paper. It's rated for liquids, grease and it's rated for electrical.

### Extinguishers
Class A : dry fires, wood, 
Class B : liquid fires, gas and oil
Class C : electrical fires

# Regulation

## Disposal

### Methods
After upgrading a computer, or replacing a broken device, what do you do with the leftover parts? If the parts are still good, they can be donated or sold. Parts that no longer work must be disposed of, but they must be disposed of responsibly.

The proper disposal or recycling of hazardous computer components is a global issue. Make sure to follow regulations that govern how to dispose of specific items. Organizations that violate these regulations can be fined or face expensive legal battles. Regulations for the disposal of the items on this page vary from state to state and from country to country. Check your local environmental regulatory agency.

**Batteries**
Batteries often contain rare earth metals that can be harmful to the environment. These metals do not decay and remain in the environment for many years. Mercury is commonly used in the manufacturing of batteries and is extremely harmful to humans.

Recycling batteries should be standard practice. All batteries are subject to disposal procedures that comply with local environmental regulations.

**Monitors**
Handle CRT monitors with care. Extremely high voltage can be stored in CRT monitors, even after being disconnected from a power source.

Monitors contain glass, metal, plastics, lead, barium, and rare earth metals. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), monitors can contain approximately 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of lead. Monitors must be disposed of in compliance with environmental regulations.

**Toner Kits, Cartridges, and Developers**
Used printer toner kits and printer cartridges must be disposed of properly in compliance with environmental regulations. They can also be recycled. Some toner cartridge suppliers and manufacturers take empty cartridges for refilling. Kits to refill inkjet printer cartridges are available but are not recommended, because the ink might leak into the printer, causing irreparable damage. Using refilled inkjet cartridges might also void the inkjet printer warranty.

**Chemical Solvents and Aerosol Cans**
Contact the local sanitation company to learn how and where to dispose of the chemicals and solvents used to clean computers. Never dump chemicals or solvents down a sink or dispose of them in a drain that connects to public sewers.

**Cell Phones and tablets**
The EPA recommends individuals check with local health and sanitation agencies for their preferred way to depose of electronics such as cell phones, tablets, and computers. Most computer equipment and mobile devices contain hazardous materials, such as heavy metals, that do not belong in a landfill because they contaminate the earth. Local communities may also have recycling programs.

### Safety Data Sheets
Hazardous materials are sometimes called toxic waste. These materials can contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, or mercury. The regulations for the disposal of hazardous materials vary by state or country. Contact the local recycling or waste removal authorities in your community for information about disposal procedures and services.

A Safety Data Sheet (SDS), formerly known as a Material Safety and Data Sheet (MSDS), is a fact sheet that summarizes information about material identification, including hazardous ingredients that can affect personal health, fire hazards, and first-aid requirements. The SDS contains chemical reactivity and incompatibility information. It also includes protective measures for the safe handling and storage of materials and spill, leak, and disposal procedures. To determine if a material is classified as hazardous, consult the manufacturerâ€™s SDS which in the U.S. is required by OSHA when the material is transferred to a new owner.

The SDS explains how to dispose of potentially hazardous materials in the safest manner. Always check local regulations concerning acceptable disposal methods before disposing of any electronic equipment.

In the European Union, the regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) came into effect on June 1, 2007, replacing various directives and regulations with a single system.

Any IT operation must have procedures in place covering safety, communication, professionalism, and environmental impact. These must be standard for all people with access to the system and must be accurately communicated and recorded for reference. The procedures must also be based on industry best practices. The CompTIA A+ 1102 test assesses your knowledge of operational procedures in 22% of the questions. A little over half (about 56%) of the questions about operational procedures will begin with a scenario.

## Documentation and Support Systems
The **[final step in the troubleshooting process]** and is vital to the smooth running of the network and system. Documentation best practices and policies are designed to streamline the running and troubleshooting of a network or system. Questions in this section will be scenario based, and you should be able to implement best practices pertaining to creating and maintaining documentation as well as the support systems involved in the documentation process.

### Ticketing Systems
A system that creates individual tickets or requests for assistance from the IT department. A ticketing system provides a **[method of tracking]**, addressing, and recalling instances of issues encountered by users. A ticketing system also provides **accountability**, reporting, collaboration, remediation, and escalation tracking to ensure that the help desk is running as efficiently and effectively as possible.

#### User Information
When opening a ticket, the user information is typically the **[first thing collected]**. This information is essential for communication between the user and the technician responding to the ticket. User information may include the user name, full name, phone number, and/or email address of the user.

#### Device Information

Device information is collected to provide the technician with **[additional insight]** into what may be the cause of the problem. Examples of device information include device type, model number, OS being used, and network access type, among others.

#### Description of Problems
The user will be asked to enter a description of the issues encountered. It is important to gather as much information from the user as possible. For example, what is occurring, when does it occur, and what actions the user took to initiate the problem.

#### Categories
Most ticketing systems have the ability to categorize issues. Categorizing allows for the ticket to be **filtered and referred** to the person or department that is best suited to address the issues. For example, categories may include database issues, operating system issues, networking issues, or peripheral issues.

#### Severity
A **[severity level]** is assigned to a ticket by the user and the technician to address the **urgency** of the problem. Keep in mind that when a user is reporting a problem, the user may feel that the issue is more severe and urgent than it actually is. The technician must use their best judgment when assigning severity levels to a ticket.

#### Escalation Levels
Also know as **[levels of support]**, refer to the structure of the IT department as a whole. While every enterprise structure may vary, they are typically numbered levels 1 to 3, with level 1 responders having basic knowledge, level 2 having advanced knowledge, and level 3 having expert knowledge. If a level 1 technician is unable to address the problem, it can be escalated to the next level.

#### Clear and Concise Written Communication
Written communication between the user, the technician, and any escalation points should be clear and concise. There are **three stages** of documentation of communication between the involved parties: the description of the problem, progress notes, and the resolution.

##### Problem Description
The first stage involves the description of the problem. The problem description should be as clear and understandable as possible so the user, technician, and any other person reading can follow it. Try to avoid using highly technical jargon or references.

##### Progress Notes
Should be written to **[document the steps]** that are being taken to address or resolve the issue. Progress notes should also document the **communications** that occur between the user and the technician so that, if reviewed, a clear timeline of actions and interactions is presented, which may be needed for escalation or review.

##### Problem Resolution
The final part of the written communication documentation is the problem resolution. This should include what steps were taken to resolve the problem, and it should be easy to follow by others, such as another technician who encounters the same issue.

### Asset Management
The process of keeping track of the **[fixed tangible assets]** of a company. Asset management systems track physical assets throughout their lifespan.

#### Inventory Lists
A record of all the assets of a company detailing equipment types and quantity. Inventory lists are useful and sufficient for smaller enterprises but may become overwhelming with larger inventories.

#### Database System
For **[larger inventories or more complex asset lists]**, a database system can be created and used. A database system has the ability to store and retrieve asset information quickly and efficiently and can also provide insight into asset usage, value, and trends. Asset management systems are database systems.

#### Asset Tags and IDs
An asset tag or ID is a method used to **[track equipment]** within an asset management system, typically in the form of a scannable barcode with an assigned numeric number. This allows the asset management system to identify all equipment as well as retrieve data associated with the asset tag.

#### Procurement Life Cycle
The procurement life cycle is the **[life cycle of an asset within an enterprise]**. The procurement life cycle for IT typically starts with the purchase of the asset, the deployment of the asset, the continued management of the asset, and the retirement of the asset. The procurement life cycle can be tracked manually or with an asset management system.

#### Warranty and Licensing
Some assets may come with the manufacturers’ warranties or licensing agreements. The warranty and licensing information can be tracked with asset management as well. Monitoring warranty and licensing information is necessary to stay up to date on potential warranty or licensing expirations that **may affect the life cycle** of the asset.

#### Assigned Users
Are the end users who are responsible for an asset. Assigned users are typically monitored by an IT manager who is ultimately responsible for the assets and users of those assets, such as laptops or cellular phones.

### Types of Documents
It’s vital to ensure that you read any required documentation before you begin working on any system. Documentation includes items such as processes and procedures, network diagrams, **[knowledge base articles]** (also known as **KBs**), and much more. It’s also important to document any fixes that have been implemented so they can be referenced later. Another example of documentation includes **[safety data sheets (SDS)]**, formerly referred to as material safety data sheets (MSDS). The SDS outlines the procedures for disposing of hazardous materials. This should be referenced if there is a question about properly disposing of hazardous material. The SDS is administered by the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** within the United States.

#### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
A policy put in place by an organization that states which types of actions are acceptable to perform using their equipment. Many organizations implement AUPs that state how employees are allowed to use their **[company-owned devices]**. Whenever accessing a public Wi-Fi, such as at a coffee shop, you will have to acknowledge the AUP before getting access to the network.

#### Network Topology Diagram
Are extremely helpful for performing any network upgrades or even troubleshooting networking problems. The network topology diagrams will provide a visual representation of how the network is laid out, including both logical and physical information for the devices. **[[Visio]]** is a popular tool used when creating network diagrams.

#### Regulatory Compliance Requirements
Networks are required to follow specific regulatory requirements, which can be local, state, or federal. Common regulations include the **[[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]**, which regulates how companies protect and maintain financial records and data. The **[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)]]**, contains federal regulations that protect the privacy of medically related **[personally identifiable information (PII)]** and data. The **[[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)]]** regulates the processing and handling of student data. The **[[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)]]** protects consumer information gathered by financial institutions.

##### Splash Screens
Compliance is the process of adhering to all relevant regulations, including local and federally set guidelines. To document compliance, it may be necessary to use screenshots which are generally accepted forms of proof of compliance. A splash screen is a screen capture that can be used to document problems, solutions, and the installation of software. The Windows OS includes the**Steps Recorder**, which documents each mouse click with a screen capture and information on what was clicked.

#### Incident Reports
A document indicating a situation outside of the norm. Every incident report, like security alerts and indicators of compromise as specified in NIST publication 800-61r2 “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide”, may not require a full incident response and should therefore be verified to ensure an incident has actually occurred prior to executing a full incident response.

#### Incident Response
Refers to the chain of actions taken and events happening once an incident occurs. An incident is an event that has been identified as having an adverse or potentially adverse effect on an organization, such as a data breach or DDoS attack. A clear incident response plan should be established by the company and followed to ensure a proper response. An incident response plan typically follows the basic steps of detecting or verifying that the incident has actually occurred, then responding, reporting, recovering, remediating, documenting, and reviewing the incident. The NIST publication 800-61r2, “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide,” provides detailed guidelines for creating an Incident Response plan.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Document the specified steps that should be followed to comply with policies or regulations set by the company and outside entities. The SOP provides a plan of action for meeting those policies.

##### Procedures for Custom Installation of Software Package
When installing custom software packages, the entire process should be **clearly documented** by the initial technician who installed the package. This creates a document and process that can be followed by other technicians for subsequent installations of the package.

#### New-User Setup Checklist
New employees in a company need to be onboarded, which is commonly coordinated between the IT department and Human Resources. **Onboarding** is the process of entering the employee into the network, assigning relevant **permissions and devices**, and informing the new hire about **policies and procedures** for the company. A new-user setup checklist is helpful in the onboarding process to ensure all necessary actions have been taken. A new-user setup list may include assigning and showing a user how to log in to the network, informing them of AUPs and “bring your own device” (BYOD) policies, and going over email policies and procedures.

#### End-User Termination Checklist
When an employee leaves a company, the employee will need to be **[offboarded]**, which is the process of removing the user from network access and retrieving assigned devices. An end-user termination checklist is a list that provides set actions that need to be taken when an employee is offboarded and ensures that something has not been overlooked during the process.

### Knowledge Base Articles
A repository of information regarding an application or system. When working on a system or troubleshooting an issue, individuals should first visit the system’s knowledge base to see if a solution to their issue already exists.

## Change Management
The process of addressing changes within an organization. Whenever a change is going to be made in an organization, proper procedures must be followed to ensure that any negative impact on the business or users is minimized. You will need to be able to explain change management best practices.

### Documented Business Processes
Provide a high-level overview of what aspects of the business the change is expected to impact. This document states who, how, why, and when interactions occur during the change process.

#### Rollback Plan
Also known as a **[backout plan]**, documents the steps that will be taken in case of implementation or **primary plan failure**. A backout plan should include a **way to revert** to a previous version of the system before the change was applied.

#### Sandbox Testing
A sandbox test is done in a **separate environment** that matches the existing environment. It can be used to test and evaluate the effects of potential changes to a system or network without affecting the real system. Sandbox testing allows for fine-tuning of an implementation plan prior to actual deployment.

#### Responsible Staff Member
The employee designated as responsible for a particular change process. This person **oversees** the change plan as well as acts as a **point of contact** for the plan. The responsible staff member should also be able to answer questions related to the change as well as spearhead any subsequent changes to the plan.

#### Request Forms
A form that **[proposes a change]**. Request forms typically include information such as what needs to be changed, why the change is needed, and the plan for the change as well as the priority of the change. The request form also includes the rollback plan, the evaluation of the plan, and the time it will take to implement the change.

#### Purpose of the Change
The reason why the change needs to occur. This reason can be new business requirements, regulation requirements, or technological requirements.

#### Scope of the Change
Lays out what will be affected by the change. The scope may be small, affecting only a few devices, or extensive, affecting the entire network. When detailing scope, specific details should be addressed, such as how many systems will be affected, how many employees will be affected, and any other direct or indirect consequences of the change.

#### Date and Time of the Change
Specifies the timeline of the change and should be chosen to impact the least amount of business function possible.

#### Affected Systems/Impact
The systems that will be impacted by the change in some manner. This document should also include the impact the change will or may have on the affected systems, such as production time lost or how customers may be affected.

#### Risk Analysis
A detailed evaluation of the change and the risks that come with making the change. The risk analysis examines the potential failure of a change and the impact that failure may have on the company. Upon defining the new risks that may arise, the organization must choose to **accept, mitigate, or avoid the risk**.

##### Risk Level
A measurement of the potential impact of failure on the company. Risk levels include low, medium, or high risk.

#### Change Board Approvals

The change board is the group of users who are in charge of determining whether to proceed or table a potential change. The change board evaluates the entire change from all perspectives in order to decide the most effective way to proceed to provide the least amount of impact on the company and day-to-day functions.

#### End-User Acceptance
In order for a successful change to occur, all users must be on board and prepared for the change. User acceptance testing is a common practice in which real users ensure that the change doesn’t negatively affect their ability to perform tasks.

## Workstation Backup and Recovery
All organizations should have a [[Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery|BCDR]] plan documented and in place. Disaster prevention and recovery refers to the ability to be able to bounce back after any type of disaster, such as a natural disaster or a cyber attack. Questions in this section will be scenario based.

### Backup and Recovery
A backup is a stored data clone of a workstation, device, OS, files, or network that can be used in case of disaster or if needed for recovery. The backup provides a [[Recovery Point Objective|RPO]], which is a point in time to which a dataset can be restored. A backup can be a full backup of the entire dataset at a specified point in time or a partial backup of the changes since the previous backup.

#### Full
A full backup **[copies the entire dataset]** at a specific point in time and may include the OS, files, and personalizations. A full backup can be used to completely restore a dataset in case of complete failure. A full backup, however, is memory intensive and time consuming.

#### Incremental
An incremental backup uses an archive bit set to back up data written on the archive bit set **since the last incremental backup**. Once the incremental backup occurs, the archive bit set is reset and ready to store the data captured from the point of the last incremental backup. In case of failure, a full backup would need to be restored, as well as all incremental backups, until the dataset is fully restored.

#### Differential
A differential backup also employs the use of the archive bit set. Unlike the incremental backup, however, the differential backup **does not reset the archive bit set until a full backup** is completed. The differential backup grows in size until the full backup. In case of failure, a full backup would need to be restored, but unlike the incremental backup, only the latest differential backup would need to be restored for the dataset to be complete.

#### Synthetic
A synthetic backup is software that creates a full backup by combining the last full backup with incremental or differential backups to create a complete dataset. This reduces the recovery time objective (RTO), the amount of time it takes to restore a dataset.

### Backup Testing
It’s not enough to perform backups; the backups must also be tested. The test serves to show that the backup files are not corrupt and that they are backing up everything that would need to be restored in the event of a disaster.

#### Frequency
The frequency of backup testing differs, but it is recommended that backup testing be conducted **[monthly at a minimum]**, with highly sensitive or constantly changing dataset backups tested more frequently.

### Backup Rotation Schemes
A schedule used to guide the rotation of long-term data archiving by the backup source and location. Rotation schemes include the type of media used for the backup as well as the physical location of the backup. Backup media types include disk-to-tape, disk-to-disk, and disk-to-cloud.

#### Onsite vs. Offsite
Onsite backups are physically kept on the same premises as the dataset that it backs up. An offsite backup is kept in a different physical location from the dataset. Data backups should be rotated offsite in case of a major disaster.

#### Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS)
The GFS rotation scheme is a first-in, first-out schedule for rotation. Backups are taken daily. At the end of the week, the last daily backup will become the weekly backup, and at the end of the month, the last weekly backup will become the monthly backup.

#### 3-2-1 Backup Rule
Pertains to maintaining both onsite and offsite rotation. To apply this rule, three copies of a backup should be taken, with two copies of the backup kept onsite while the final copy is kept offsite.

## Safety Procedures
When dealing and working with computer components, keep safety at the forefront for both your and the device’s sake. The following sections may be delivered as scenario-based questions in the exam environment, so you must be very comfortable with these topics.

### Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Straps
Occurs when two objects with dissimilar charges come in contact with one another. Electrons are exchanged to equalize the charge, resulting in ESD, which can damage sensitive components. ESD straps are small wrist straps that can connect to an ESD mat or an ESD jacket for discharge to reduce your electrostatic presence.

### ESD Mats
An ESD mat drains excess charges away from items in contact with it. An ESD mat can either be a mat you stand on (floor mat) or a mat you place the equipment on. These ESD mats will reduce ESD risks, and some allow you to snap your ESD wristband into them for better protection.

### Equipment Grounding
Equipment grounding is a way to transport any excess electrical discharge away from the component and into the electrical ground wiring. This is a safety mechanism that is included on all outlets, significantly reducing the risk of electrical shock should there be a fault within the system.

### Proper Power Handling
The **[power supply]** is the **[most dangerous component]** of a computer to work with. A power supply contains capacitors that can hold a charge even when disconnected from a power source. If possible, it is safer to replace the power supply rather than work on it. If the power supply must be accessed, make sure that all capacitors within the power supply are discharged prior to handling. A grounding pen or a discharge pen can be used for discharging capacitors of any size.

### Proper Component Handling and Storage
Technicians must be aware of proper component handling and storage. Each component comes with safety considerations. Before attempting to handle a component, research the safety measures and concerns pertaining to the component. Properly storing components includes evaluating the **environment**, such as humidity and temperature, as well as the component’s **[potential for ESD]**.

### Antistatic Bags
A specially designed, typically pink or silver bag that collects stray static charges on its exterior, preventing the charge from reaching the sensitive components it contains.

### Compliance with Government Regulations
When dealing with a networking environment, there are several regulations to keep in mind. These include electrical codes for running high/low voltage cabling, environmental codes for disposing of chemicals or hardware, fire prevention codes requiring the specific use of dry or wet systems, and building codes that specify how cabling can be run through a building.

### Personal Safety
As a technician, you should be aware of and follow best practices for maintaining personal safety. Be familiar with the following guidelines related to personal safety when dealing with computer components.

#### Disconnect Power before Repairing PC
All power sources should be disconnected prior to working inside a computer. Power supplies are typically replaced as a whole rather than in smaller individual parts. Normally there are **no serviceable parts** inside, and, therefore, they should not be opened.

#### Lifting Techniques
Always lift heavy equipment using your legs and not your back, or use multiple people to lift the object.

#### Electrical Fire Safety
For electrical fires, use specialized **dry fire prevention or extinguishing chemicals**, such as carbon dioxide. Neither wet chemicals nor water should ever be used on electrical fires.

#### Safety Goggles
Use goggles when working with chemicals, batteries, or printer toner.

#### Air Filtration Mask
To protect yourself from an environment where dust, smoke, or other air particles exist in the surrounding atmosphere, you should wear a special mask designed to filter out these items.

---

## Environmental Impacts and Controls
You should be able to quickly analyze and apply the proper controls for any possible environmental impacts. Some questions in this area will be scenario based.

### Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
The SDS outlines the procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials. This should be referenced if there is a question about properly disposing of hazardous material. The SDS is administered by the **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** in the United States. Copies are kept locally wherever there might be contact with hazardous materials.

#### Battery Disposal
The most common batteries used in computers and electronic devices are alkaline, nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), and button cells. The Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (or just The Battery Act) provides guidelines on the disposal, collection, and recycling of batteries. All batteries should be **recycled**.

#### Toner Disposal
Toner cartridges should also be recycled. Toner cartridges contain carcinogens and heavy metals, which negatively affect the environment. Companies that recycle toner cartridges refurbish and refill the cartridges for further use.

#### Other Devices and Assets
Other devices and assets, such as display devices and mobile devices, should also be sent to a recycling facility that can safely dispose of or recycle the component. The key takeaway here is that the majority of computer and networking components you may encounter should not be thrown out but recycled.

### Temperature, Humidity, and Ventilation
The temperature and humidity in the environment where components are stored should reflect the levels outlined in the SDS. For an electronic environment, it is usually best to balance the humidity as efficiently as possible to avoid extreme condensation or static discharge. It is also important to keep a closed-in area well-ventilated so the room does not become too hot when the equipment is running.

#### Location/Equipment Placement
When placing equipment, always evaluate the location where the equipment will be placed, whether you are dealing with a single simple device or a large bank of servers or switches. Be aware of potential hazards, such as temperature, ventilation, tripping hazards, or water hazards.

#### Dust Cleanup
Can be highly detrimental to sensitive components, causing them to work less efficiently, overheat, or fail. Dust removal must be approached cautiously so as not to do more damage to the component than the dust itself. Compressed air and vacuums are common methods of dust removal.

#### Compressed Air/Vacuums
Can be used to clean out the inside of computer equipment as well as printers and other electronic devices. It is better to use **natural compressed air** versus any chemical-based compressed material. Only **specialized anti-static vacuums** should be used in electronic environments. These vacuums can help reduce the risk of a static discharge or damage to the component.

### Power Surges, Under-Voltage Events, and Power Failures
Power issues can occur anytime and anywhere. These can range from total outages to flickers or surges, and they can be devastating to equipment, data, and clients. A **power surge** occurs when a device receives too much power. An **under-voltage event**, such as a sag or brownout, occurs when the voltage dips below nominal operating levels for a set period. A **power failure** is when voltage completely stops.

#### Battery Backup
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is used to maintain power to equipment in the event of a power outage or surge when all power can be lost or drop down below a certain threshold. The UPS will automatically activate and provide power for the connected equipment via batteries.

#### Surge Suppressor
A surge suppressor works by checking for spikes in voltage along the line. If a spike is detected, the surge protector moves the excess power to the ground and only allows the proper amount to be passed along to the connected devices.

## Prohibited Content/Activity and Privacy, Licensing, and Policy
In addition to physical safety regulations, you must also be aware of and familiar with regulations pertaining to prohibited content and activity as well as privacy, licensing, and policy. You must be able to identify and explain the importance of these concepts.

### Incident Response
Refers to the chain of actions and events that are taken once an incident occurs. A clear incident response plan should be established by the company and followed to ensure a proper response. An incident response plan typically follows the basic steps of detecting or identifying the incident, then responding, reporting, recovering, remediating, documenting, and reviewing the incident.

#### Chain of Custody
Used as a legally admissible map of what, why, who, and where a material or piece of evidence is at all times during an incident response. The chain of custody documentation should address who obtained it, who secured it, who controlled it, and, if moved, why it was moved, who moved it, how it was secured during the move, and who controlled it.

#### Management and Law Enforcement
Anytime an incident occurs that triggers the incident response protocol, management should be informed. Management will help to evaluate the severity of the incident and decide whether the incident is potentially legally actionable. In some cases, law enforcement will need to be notified, depending on the case. Some regulations, such as regulations pertaining to PII, require a company to notify authorities within a set period of time, depending on the number of customers affected.

#### Copy of Drive
When responding to an incident, evidence is collected in order of volatility to provide the most accurate levels of data integrity and preservation. The **order of volatility** is RAM memory contents first, then swap files and virtual memory, network processes, system processes, filesystem information, and, finally, the raw disk blocks.

#### Documentation of Incident
Clear and precise documentation should be maintained at every step in the incident response process, beginning with the initial documentation of the incident, which may include pictures, notes, or logs. During the investigation phase of the incident and all during the process, _everything_ must be documented to maintain the incident. Any slight infraction can lead to **tainted evidence** and the investigation being sidelined.

### Licensing/Digital Rights Management (DRM)/End-User License Agreement (EULA)
For this exam, you should be very comfortable with the many types of licensing arrangements available today, including DRM and EULAs that stipulate how the software can be used.

#### Valid Licenses
A software license that is **current and not counterfeit** and, if not already used, **valid** for activation.

#### Non-Expired Licenses
A perpetual or non-expiring license is a license that, once purchased, is valid for the life of the software product. This licensing type is common with software such as video games.

#### Personal Use License vs. Corporate-Use License
A **[personal license]** is granted only to one end user for recreational purposes. At times, costly commercial software will license its product for non-commercial use to an individual or student, and this is intended for personal use only. **Corporate-use licenses** are intended for business use, typically by larger organizations, and are a form of paid commercial software licensed to a specific company for a certain number of users.

#### Open-Source License
An open-source license means that the software’s source code is freely available to the public. This means the software can be modified and recreated if desired by the end user.

### Regulated Data
Within the scope of information technology is data that must be held to a higher standard than that of other data. In cases of regulated data, the federal government has developed standards for the handling of this data.

#### Credit Card Transactions
Regulated by the standards set in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). These security standards ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain the security of such information.

#### Personal Government-Issued Information
Personal government-issued information is any personal information that is on a document issued by either the government or state, such as driver’s licenses, social security cards, or birth certificates. While there is no specific regulation pertaining to this information, it should be securely stored and kept confidential. Much of the personal information contained in these documents overlaps with other regulations pertaining to securing personal data, such as HIPAA regulations.

#### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
PII refers to any data that can be used to identify a person or individual, either as a stand-alone or in conjunction with other information. This information should always be kept secure and confidential.

#### Healthcare Data
Contains protected health information/personal health information (PHI) and is any piece of data that can identify an individual or an ailment. This information is protected and regulated through HIPAA. Electronic health records (EHR) are complete medical records of a patient in electronic form. EHRs contain highly sensitive data and should be kept secure and confidential following HIPAA’s guidelines for usage.

#### Data Retention Requirements
The policies and regulations set in place that require a specified amount of time that data should be retained. These regulations vary by data type as well as by companies. Be aware of data retention requirements that affect your data type.

---

## Communication and Professionalism
IT technicians have to communicate effectively with many different audiences. Those working in IT should be aware of the following concepts in order to use proper communication techniques and professionalism. Questions in this section will be scenario based.

### Professional Appearance and Attire
As an IT technician, you will be judged based on your appearance and attire. You should dress in accordance with company policy as well as how you wish to be perceived. You want to instill immediate confidence and respect in those you interact with, which begins with your personal appearance.

#### Attire in the Given Environment
The attire you wear should reflect the environment in which you are working. Overdressing or underdressing will affect the way you are perceived by the client.

##### Formal
Formal, also known as **business formal** or **business professional**, usually requires a higher standard of dress that includes suits and ties, long-sleeved button-down shirts, dark colors, and dress shoes for men. Women are typically expected to wear a business suit or business skirt. Women’s attire can be more lightly colored but should be conservative in nature, with nylon stockings and dress shoes.

##### Business Casual
Business casual provides a more lax style of dress for both men and women. This style, however, is not to be confused with casual or street attire. Appropriate clothing items for men include dress pants or khakis, collared shirts, and a more lenient color palette. Women have many more options in clothing but should maintain a conservative style.

### Language
You should always use proper language when speaking with a customer or client. The majority of end users are not very technology oriented, so you should **avoid tech slang and acronyms**. Instead, break down the meaning of all terms used in a constructive manner. We sometimes get caught up in technical language and should always avoid “tech speak” or talking above the client’s head.

### Attitude
You should display a positive attitude when dealing with technical issues that may be complex. Use all cases as lessons to acquire more knowledge about technology. Also, be **confident** when discussing technical issues with end users. Be aware that it is more about being able to _find_ the right answer than having all the answers memorized. Regardless of the situation, remain positive and project confidence in your work. Customers know that you don’t know everything, but you should avoid giving the impression that you are unsure of the procedure for finding a solution.

### Listening
When discussing issues with a customer, **actively listen** and **take notes** when appropriate. Customers should never have to repeat themselves because you did not write down key details. Additionally, **never interrupt** customers while they are giving you information. Let them tell you their story in full, and then you can respond with follow-up questions if needed. Always listen to understand what the customer is saying.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Remember that some people have different cultural backgrounds than others, so you should remain culturally sensitive to their requests. A **language** barrier may present itself, making communication difficult. Maintain respect and composure and do not treat the person with a dismissive nature. Also, be mindful that other cultures have different **mannerisms and values**.

#### Professional Titles
You should always greet users with respect and use their proper professional titles when addressing them. If someone is a director, don’t refer to them as a manager—not in person, in support documentation, or on the phone with one of your colleagues. This is an easy way to offend someone.

### Punctuality
Punctuality is extremely important for an IT professional. Often, end users have meetings or their own work to complete, and you are seen as the entity that is holding them up. Always arrive on time for pre-scheduled appointments and contact clients if there will be any delay relating to the service. If anything keeps you from arriving at the client’s location on time, notify the customer of your situation beforehand and give them an estimated arrival time.

### Distractions
While working with clients, be sure to avoid any type of distractions. This includes text messages, phone calls, or simply having conversations with other colleagues. You never want to give the impression that the end user does not have 100% of your attention. Their technical problem must appear to be the number one priority when you are in their presence, even though that may not be the case.

#### Personal Calls
Personal calls should not be answered when working with a client. Silence phones or send incoming calls straight to voicemail to avoid interruption.

#### Texting/Social Media Sites

Texting should also be avoided when interacting with a client. Answering text messages or receiving constant notifications when with a client is disrespectful. Additionally, do not browse social media sites when working with a client.

#### Personal Interruptions

Personal interruptions should be kept to a minimum. This is especially true for individuals working from home. Maintain a space where personal interruptions can be minimized.

### Difficult Customers or Situations

Working as an IT technician, you will be faced with stressed and anxious clients who may become difficult. While these situations do occur in the field, it is important to adhere to some basic rules for diffusing the situation with the following five don’ts and one do.

#### **DON’T** Argue

Arguing with customers will not get the result that either of you are hoping to achieve. Try not to become defensive when speaking with a client, even if they seem like they are being unreasonable. Letting the customer know that you understand their frustration will help them to feel confident that you can help them solve the problem.

#### **DON’T** Be Defensive

When a client is upset or angry, he or she may lash out at you as a way of venting their frustration. Avoid being defensive and taking it personally. Remind the customer that you are there to help and you understand how frustrated they are. Lead the client to focus on the problem and not on you.

#### **DON’T** Dismiss Customer Problems

Try to avoid dismissing the customer’s problems or issues. Even though an issue may not seem like a big deal to you, it may be very important to them.

#### **DON’T** Be Judgmental

Avoid being judgemental when working with clients. Something that may seem easy and self-explanatory to you could be quite challenging and difficult for them. It’s important to keep in mind that not everyone is tech-savvy.

#### **DON’T** Recount Experiences on Social Media

Never use social media as an outlet to vent about a particular customer or experience. Things on the internet typically stay there forever, and this could portray you or your company in a bad light.

#### **DO** Clarify Customer Statements

Ask questions to ascertain the root of the problem. When a customer tells you their story, restate what you believe the problem to be to confirm an understanding through the verification process. Some helpful clarification tactics include asking the client to walk you through the problem, asking open-ended questions, restating what the client is saying, and asking specific questions to verify your understanding of the problem.

### Using a Timeline

When working on a client issue, always be prepared to set initial expectations of the timeline with the promise of action to follow. Keep the customer informed of any changes, but make sure all promises are kept in a timely manner.

#### Offer Options

If possible, give the customer multiple options and alternatives. Even if you prefer one way, remember this is the end user’s equipment and they should be given the opportunity to weigh their options. This may include the option to repair or replace the problem device or component. Do not make the customer feel as if they are being railroaded into a specific choice.

#### Use Documentation

Keep up-to-date documentation and provide this to the customer when the service is complete. Customers will feel more at ease if they can review what work was performed on their PC, as they will know exactly how their money was spent on the repair. Using thorough documentation will also protect you in case of a dispute.

#### Follow Up

When the device has been returned to the customer after service, follow up at a later time to verify satisfaction. This is one of the most important steps for maintaining repeat customers, as they will feel like you genuinely care about the service.

### Dealing with Private Customer Materials

When working on a customer’s issue, use best practices in handling their data. This is the customer’s private information and directly accessing this data is usually not required to complete a repair. It is your duty to keep that information safe and secure for as long as it’s in your possession.

#### Locations of Private Materials

Access to the locations of private customer materials, whether on a computer, desktop, printer, hard drive, etc., should be limited and done in a secure location. Be mindful of who may be able to view or gain access to private materials to minimize the possibility of data breaches.

## Scripting
Scripting can be used to automate IT management processes. It is important to be familiar with all of these concepts.

### Script File Types
There are numerous scripting languages in use, each with its own syntax and nuances. You should be familiar with the most common script languages and be able to recognize their file types.
**.bat**—A batch file is a series of commands to be run by the Windows operating system stored in a plain text file.
**.ps1**—A .ps1 file is used to run scripts in Powershell.
**.vbs**—A .vbs file contains lines of codes in the Visual Basic programming language that are encoded in plain text format.
**.sh**—A .sh file is like the batch files of Windows, but they can be executed in Linux or Unix.
**.js**—A .js file is a script written in JavaScript.
**.py**—A .py script is a script written in the Python programming language.

### Use Cases for Scripting
Use cases for scripting are scenarios that you are likely to encounter as an IT technician. You should be familiar with the most common use cases.

#### Basic Automation
Automation uses a set script to perform a specific task that needs to remain constant each time the script is run. Basic automation may be used for creating users or adding users to a group.

#### Restarting Machines
Scripting is useful for restarting machines when multiple machines need to be restarted. By creating a script, you automate the process rather than having to command each machine individually.

#### Remapping Network Drives
Mapping a drive is the process of mounting a remote filesystem to a drive letter. Creating a script for the process ensures a reproducible result each time.

#### Installation of Applications
Scripting can be used for the installation of applications to ease the process. For example, a script may be written that requires the successful installation of all prerequisites before the application is installed rather than having to manually install each prerequisite prior to application installation.

#### Automated Backups
Scripts may also be used to automate the backup process to increase reliability. For example, a script may be used to automate the backup of a SQL database.

#### Gathering of Information/Data
When dealing with information and data gathering about a network, device, or batch of devices, scripting can be more efficient than using a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. With a scripting command, you are able to view the exact data you need without having to maneuver through a GUI.

#### Initiating Updates
Installing updates is a common automated process offered on operating systems such as the Windows OS. However, this process may not update and install a patch as quickly as it may be needed. To immediately initiate an update, a script may be used.

### Other Considerations
While using scripts can be highly effective, there are also many considerations to be aware of that may affect your device or your entire system.

#### Introducing Malware
Be aware of the potential for introducing malware into a system via a script. Sometimes you may need additional scripts to aid in the functionality or a script. Scripts can be imported using a third-party tool. Third-party tools, however, are a common environment for malware to reside. Malware may be attached to the script and inserted unintentionally.

#### Changing System Settings
Scripts, such as those for basic automation, are commonly used to make changes to a system. However, if not properly executed, the script may make unintentional changes to other system settings. Try new scripts in a test environment before implementing them, if possible.

#### Browser or System Crashes
Scripting can be a powerful tool in helping to automate processes. However, if not properly constructed, a script can inadvertently consume resources, such as RAM, leading to system crashes.

## Remote Access Technologies
Accessing devices remotely is a major part of troubleshooting issues. Questions in this section will be scenario based, and you will need to be able to identify and use these common methods and tools.

### Methods and Tools
Methods and tools for remote connection vary and may be dependent upon the OS.

#### [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]]
A Microsoft proprietary technology for remotely accessing Windows computers. RDP provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. RDP uses TCP port 3389.

#### [[Virtual Private Network|VPN]]
A VPN can be used for secure remote access by creating an encrypted tunnel through which the data is transmitted and accessed. Common VPN configurations include a site-to-site VPN, a client-to-site VPN, or a clientless VPN.

#### Virtual Network Computer (VNC)

VNC is an open-source protocol similar to RDP that provides a tool for sharing desktops. VNC operates on a client-server model and usually only allows the use of one console on an OS at a time.

#### Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH creates a two-way communication connection between computers over a network connection. SSH is a terminal-based program with no graphical interface. SSH operates on port 22.

#### Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)

RMM provides a way for a company to monitor and manage multiple devices over a wide range of locations through a single interface. There are numerous RMM software packages available on the market. RMM software requires the placement of an agent on each connected device that reports back to the primary agent or the managed service provider (MSP).

#### Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA)
MSRA is a Windows program that allows for remote connection to a compatible device by a trusted user via an invitation. RDP must be allowed and active for a MSRA connection to be established.

#### Third-Party Tools
Many third-party tools can provide a quick, reliable, and efficient way to connect to computers.

##### Screen-Sharing Software
One common feature that most third-party remote access tools include is screen sharing. A screen-sharing feature allows a technician to view the client’s screen and see exactly what they are seeing. Popular examples are Splashtop and TeamViewer.

##### Video-Conferencing Software
Video-conferencing software is similar to screen-sharing software but offers added functionality, such as allowing multiple users to join in at once as well as calendar invitations and attendee management. Popular examples include Microsoft Teams and Zoom.

##### File Transfer Software

File transfer software is software dedicated solely to sharing files. Popular examples include Dropbox and OneDrive.

##### Desktop Management Software
An extension of screen-sharing, which, when integrated with other management software such as Intun, allows for complete device management remotely. To be considered desktop management software, the extension must be configured to await an incoming connection.

### Security Considerations for Each Method
When considering which remote access option to use, it’s vital to consider the security ramifications. Take into consideration the type of data being transmitted, the encryption level of the method, and the transmission method. Keep in mind that any remote connection accessed via an internet connection may be vulnerable to attack.

**RDP**—RDP may be vulnerable through the use of weak credentials as well as the known usage of port 3389, which may be targeted for an on-path attack.

**VPN**—A VPN may be vulnerable through weak encryption, leaks, and malware infection transmission.

**VNC**—The most glaring security concern of a VNC is that it is open source and is not natively encrypted. Encryption may be added via a plug-in.

**SSH**—The main security concerns with SSH is the ability of SSH to port forward as well as the convenience of users sharing keys.

**RMM**—RMM’s security issues include embedded malware, vulnerability to brute-force attacks, and the human component through credential sharing or targeted social engineering attacks.

**MSRA**—MSRA is only accessible via the run dialog box and is not automatically configured to connect via an internet connection. Firewalls and routers disrupt the functionality of MSRA unless configured properly.

**Third-party tools**—Be wary when using third-party tools. Each type of tool may be vulnerable to any number of threats, such as weak credentials, brute-force attacks, on-path attacks, embedded malware, weak or no encryption, etc.

### Admission Policy

We ask that you arrive at the test center 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time. This will give you adequate time to complete the necessary sign-in procedures. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late for an exam appointment and are refused admission, this will result in the forfeiture of your exam fee.

Please be prepared to present two forms of original (no photo copies), valid (unexpired) IDs; one form as a primary ID (government issued with name, recent recognizable photo, and signature) and one form as a secondary ID (with at least a name and signature, or name and recent recognizable photo). The first and last name on the registration must match exactly the first and last name on both of the IDs that are presented on test day. For full details visit [http://certification.comptia.org/testing/test-policies/candidate-id-policy](https://certification.comptia.org/testing/test-policies/candidate-id-policy)

For candidates who are minors (17 years of age and under), please note the minor must have guardian authorization for each testing event. In addition, the minor must have a single form of photo ID (e.g school ID) and must be accompanied at the testing center by an adult who has proper government-issued ID. For full details visit [http://certification.comptia.org/testing/test-policies/candidate-id-policy](http://certification.comptia.org/testing/test-policies/candidate-id-policy)

Prior to taking a CompTIA exam at a test center the capture of a digital photo and signature is required.

You will not be allowed to take any personal items with you into the testing room. This includes all bags, books not authorized by the testing program, notes, calculators, cell phones, pagers, watches and wallets.

Service

- internal customers are still your colleague
- we are there to solve a problem
- introduce say hello
- listening to hear 
- mirroring
- maintain posture
- ask questions
- sympathy over empathy
- dont interrupt
- reassure, of your abilities
- have responses to common questions
- treat all customers with equity
- timestamp frustrations

Follow up 
- ask for their opinion and experience with the service
- provide them with your solution
- make sure they understand the solution

Expectations
- dont over promise
- always covey expectations clearly and concisely
- always deliver on what you do promise

- compromise in the direction of the customer as often as possible

Standards

Zero Defect (or aim for perfection)

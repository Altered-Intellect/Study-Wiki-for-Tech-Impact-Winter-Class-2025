# Random Access Memory | [[Random Access Memory]] 
This is the memory bank for data currently in use by a computer or device. It is a temporary location to store data and applications.
RAM is the temporary working storage for data and programs that are being accessed by the CPU. Unlike ROM, RAM is volatile memory, which means that the contents are erased every time the computer is powered off.
Adding more RAM in a computer enhances the system performance. For instance, more RAM increases the memory capacity of the computer to hold and process programs and files. With less RAM, a computer must swap data between RAM and the much slower hard drive. The maximum amount of RAM that can be installed is limited by the form factor of the motherboard.
You must be able to identify and install different RAM types. These questions will be scenario based.
 

# Read Only Memory | [ROM]
An essential computer chip is the read-only memory (ROM) chip. ROM chips are located on the motherboard and other circuit boards and contain instructions that can be directly accessed by a CPU. The instructions stored in ROM include basic operation instructions such as booting the computer and loading the operating system.
ROM is nonvolatile which means that the contents are not erased when the computer is powered off.
Information is written to a ROM chip when it is manufactured. A ROM chip that cannot be erased or re-written is now obsolete. The term ROM still tends to be used generically for any read-only memory chip type.

## [PROM]
Information on a programmable read-only memory chip is written after it is manufactured. PROMs are manufactured blank and then can be programmed by a PROM programmer when needed. Generally, these chips cannot be erased and can only be programmed once.

## [EPROM]
Erasable programmable read-only memory is non-volatile but can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light. EPROMs usually have a transparent quartz window on the top of the chip. Constant erasing and reprogramming could ultimately render the chip useless.

## [EEPROM]
Information is written to an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory chip after it is manufactured and without removing it from the device. EEPROM chips are also called Flash ROMs since its contents can be "flashed" for deletion. EEPROMs are often used to store a computer system's BIOS.

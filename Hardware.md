Hardware concepts are one of the most heavily emphasized areas of IT assessed on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam. Around **25%** of the questions on the test pertain to this area. You’ll need to be highly competent in identifying, using, and connecting hardware components and devices. The recent increase in remote work also makes it necessary to know about different devices that support that workforce. As you study, keep in mind that nearly all the questions (**86%**) about hardware will begin with a **scenario**.

## [[Cabling and Ports]]

## [[Computational Memory]]
Internal components that store binary information that is used in the computations that a computer executes.
## [[Storage]]
The physical components used to store data and files that a computer system needs to operate. A number of different types of devices are available for data storage on a PC. Data drives provide non-volatile storage of data, meaning that when the drive loses power, the data is retained and available the next time the drive is powered on. Some drives have fixed media, and other drives have removable media. Some offer the ability to read and write data, while others only allow data to be accessed, but not written. Data storage devices can be classified according to the media on which the data is stored; magnetic like HDD and tape drives, solid state, or optical.
You must be able to identify and install different storage devices. Questions about these will be scenario based.

## [[Cases]]
The case of a desktop computer houses the internal components such as the power supply, motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), memory, disk drives, and assorted adapter cards.  
Cases are typically made of plastic, steel, or aluminum and provide the framework to support, protect, and cool the internal components. A device form factor refers to its physical design and look. Desktop computers are available in a variety of form factors including: 

## [[Power Supply]]
Electricity from wall outlets is provided in alternating current (AC). However, all components inside a computer require direct current (DC) power. To obtain DC power, computers use a power supply, to convert AC power into a lower voltage DC power. There are different types of power supplies to fit different types of computers. Each power supply has specific features related to capacity and connectors. You must be able to select the proper power supply type and features needed in any given scenario.

## [[Motherboards]]
The motherboard, also known as the system board or the main board, is the backbone of the computer. It provides the circuitry by which all parts of a computer communicate with each other, from the processor to the power supply. Every part of a computer interacts with the motherboard in some fashion. You should be able to install and configure motherboards, as well as the CPUs and add-on cards you plug into them, in a given scenario.
a motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains buses, or electrical pathways, that interconnect electronic components. These components may be soldered directly to the motherboard, or added using sockets, expansion slots, and ports.

## [[Peripherals]]

### Drivers for the OS
Most devices will come with **easy installation media**. Windows devices will automatically recognize a device upon connection and powerup. Install the appropriate **driver** for the OS and the device. Install any **updates** for the appropriate drivers.

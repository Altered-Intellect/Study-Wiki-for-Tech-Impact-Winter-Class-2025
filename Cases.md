# Types
- Horizontal case
	This computer case is horizontally oriented on the user's desk with the monitor often positioned on top and was popular with early computer systems. This form factor is often used for home theater PCs (HTPCs).
- Full-Size Tower
	This vertically-oriented case is typically located on the floor under, or beside, a desk or table. It provides room for expansion to accommodate additional components such as disk drives, adapter cards, and more.
- Compact Tower
	This is a smaller version of the full-size tower and is commonly found in the corporate environment. It may also be called a mini-tower or small form factor (SFF) model. It can be located on the user's desk or on the floor. It provides limited room for expansion.
- All-in-one
	All of the computer system components are integrated into the display. They often include touch-screen input and built-in microphone and speakers. Depending on the model, all-in-one computers offer little to no expansion capabilities. The power supply is often external to the computer.

This list is not exhaustive, as many case manufacturers have their own naming conventions. These may include super tower, full tower, mid tower, mini tower, cube case, and more.  
Computer components tend to generate a lot of heat; therefore, computer cases contain fans that move air through the case. As the air passes warm components, it absorbs heat and then exits the case. This process keeps the computer components from overheating. Cases are also designed to protect against damage from static electricity. The computerâ€™s internal components are grounded via attachment to the case.

**Note**: Computer cases are also referred to as the computer chassis, cabinet, tower, housing, or simply box.

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Case size                   | Larger cases often require larger fans because smaller fans cannot create enough air flow                                                                                  |
| Fan speed                   | Larger fans can spin more slowly than smaller fans for the same air flow rate, which reduces noise                                                                         |
| # of components             | Multiple components on a computer create additional heat, which requires more, larger, or faster fans                                                                      |
| Physical environment        | The case fans must be able to disperse enough heat to keep the interior of the case cool. The amount of ambient temp, dust, and humidity must be taken into consideration. |
| # of mounting places        | Different cases have different #'s of mounting places for fans                                                                                                             |
| Location of mounting places | Different cases have different #'s of locations for fans                                                                                                                   |
| Electrical connections      | Some case fans are connected directly to the motherboard, while others are connected directly to the power supply                                                          |

# Selection
The choice of motherboard and external components influences the selection of the case and power supply. The motherboard form factor must be matched with the correct type of computer case and power supply. For example, an ATX motherboard requires both an ATX-compatible case and power supply.

You can select a larger computer case to accommodate additional components that may be required in the future. Or you might select a smaller case that requires minimal space. In general, the computer case should be durable, easy to service, and have enough room for expansion.

- **Type** : The type of motherboard you choose determines the type of case that can be used. The size and shape must match exactly.
- **Size** : If a computer has many components, it will need more room for airflow to keep the system cool.
- **[[Power Supply]]** : You must match the power rating and connection type of the power supply to the type of motherboard you have chosen. Cases often come with a power supply preinstalled. In this situation, you still need to verify that the power supply provides enough power to operate all the components that will be installed in the case.
- **Appearance** : For some people, how the case looks doesn't matter at all. For others, it is critical. There are many case designs to choose from if it is necessary to have a case that is attractive. 
- **Status Display** : What is going on inside the case can be very important. LED indicators that are mounted on the outside of the case can tell you if the system is receiving power, when the hard drive is being used, and when the computer is in sleep or hibernate mode.
- **Vents** : All cases have a vent on the power supply, and some have another vent on the back to help draw air into or out of the system. Some cases are designed with more vents in the event that the system needs a way to dissipate an unusual amount of heat. This situation may occur when many devices are installed close together in the case.

A computer has many internal components that generate heat while the computer is running. Case fans should be installed to move cooler air into the computer case while moving heat out of the case. When choosing case fans, there are several factors to consider as described in the following table.

**Note**: The direction of air flow created by all the fans in the case must work together to inject cooler air and expel hotter air. Installing a fan backwards or using fans with the incorrect size or speed for the case can cause the air flows to work against each other.

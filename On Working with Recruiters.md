>I recently mentioned to someone that I am a Recruiter, and their response was “what is the difference between your job and Indeed”? This question made me realize that there probably are many people who do not know what a recruiter does and why working with a recruiter is beneficial. I cannot speak for all recruiters as we all tend to operate differently, but here are a few things you can expect as a candidate should you decide to work with me:  
>
>Career & job search advice ✅  
>Note: My account managers and I have direct contact with hiring managers. We are therefore knowledgeable of what they look for on resumes, qualities and skills they would like candidates to have, and best interview practices.  
>
>Resume visibility ✅  
>Note: Due to our close relationships with our hiring managers, we submit resumes directly to them, guaranteeing your resume will be viewed by the right person. When you apply on job boards, you’re competing with hundreds of other resumes, so yours may never be seen.  
  >
>Professional resume help ✅  
>Note: I am professionally trained to provide resume tips.  
>
>A professional advocate ✅  
>Note: Not all recruiters are like this, but I focus on rapport and relationship building with my candidates. I value every and all conversation I have with them and enjoy getting to know them personally. I learn from them as they are the ones using the technologies day in and out. As a result, I can and will push back on hiring managers should they decide not to move forward. I can say, they’re an 80% fit and are willing to learn tool x (for example), why not talk to them for 15 minutes?  
>  
>Saved time on the job search ✅  
>Note: After we hop on a call so I can better understand what you’re looking for, I have you in mind for opportunities and can send you jobs accordingly.  
  >
>Much more ✅

>Let’s work together!

what is a recruiter
- someone who matches candidates with job opportunities
- 

staffing company/agency recruiters
- have clients, companies that recruit for
- - can submit to several companies and positions
- will not tell you who they work for, they want to be compensated for their work
- receive compensation for each job placement, means that things can come across as salesy
- job portals, apply to open positions, resume goes directly to the recruiters

internal/corporate recruiters
- work for a company, do not have clients
- work directly with hiring manager and have some relationship
- salary instead of compensation with commission, typically


Linkin Tricks
- search the name of the staffing company, pick your local area, and search IT recruiters
- search company you are interested in, pick local area, search "talent"
- go to careers tab on company website, search by location and keywords, look for emails and names of recruiters
- 

signs

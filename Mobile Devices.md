The purpose of assessing your knowledge and skills in this area is to be sure you know how to configure and install all types of mobile devices, including, but not limited to, laptops. This does not stop after the installation and configuration are complete, however. You must also be able to ensure continued connectivity for the end-users. Approximately **15%** of the questions on the **CompTIA A+ Core Series 1101 test** pertain to mobile device concepts. Note that approximately **75%** of these questions will begin with a **scenario**.

The mobile computing environment is designed with higher tolerances than desktops or servers due to the space constraint. This can make repairing mobile devices difficult especially if the company designs the devices has little support for non-company repairs.

# Mobility
Mobility in information technology means the ability to access information electronically from different locations outside of the home or office. Mobile connectivity is limited only by the availability of cellular or data networks. Mobile devices have self-contained power in the form of rechargeable batteries, are generally small and lightweight, and do not rely on other connected peripheral devices, such as a mouse and keyboard, to operate.

## Laptops
Portable computers, that usually run full versions of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, MacOS or Linux.

Laptops can have the same computing power and memory resources as desktop computers. As shown in the figure, laptops integrate a screen, keyboard, and a pointing device, such as a touchpad, in one portable device. Laptops can be run from an internal battery or from an electrical outlet. They offer connectivity options such as wired or wireless Ethernet networking and Bluetooth.

Laptops offer device connection options such as USB and HDMI. Laptops frequently have speaker and microphone connections as well. Some laptops offer graphic connectivity using different types of graphics standards, similar to desktops. However, in order to make laptops more portable, some peripheral connection options may require additional hardware, such as a dock or port replicator.

In order to increase portability, laptops may sacrifice some of the advantages that are offered by desktop computers. For example, laptops may not use the fastest processors available due to cooling concerns and high power consumption. Laptop memory upgrades may be limited, and some types of laptop memory are more expensive than comparable desktop memory. Laptops lack the expansion capability of desktops as well. Special-purpose expansion cards and large volume storage often cannot be installed in laptops. For example, upgrading the graphics subsystem in a laptop is likely to be impossible.

### Hardware and Components
You must be able to **[install and configure]** the hardware and components of a laptop in a given scenario. You should be aware of the following hardware and be comfortable replacing it.
Most laptop manufacturers provide service information to replace components like the battery, display, or keyboard

### Replacement
Hardware/device replacement in laptops differs from desktop replacements. Space comes at a premium and the **correct tools** should be used to disassemble and reassemble laptops and their components. Be aware of the main techniques and tools used to replace laptop components. Always check **manufacturer documentation** before attempting hardware/device replacement.

#### Battery
Laptop **battery chemistry** is most commonly nickel-cadmium (NiCd), lithium-ion (Li-ion), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), or lithium-polymer (Li-poly). Lithium batteries are the most common and keep their capacity consistent but degrades over time when charging.
When replacing a battery, determine if it is **internal or external** first. If the battery is external, remove the battery pack and replace it with a new one. If the battery is internal, remove the bottom cover, locate the battery, disconnect it from the motherboard, and remove any screws holding it in place, then remove the old battery, insert the new battery, and replace the screws and back cover. The process of removing a battery can take from 6 mins to over an hour, depending on if it is internal or external.
The make and model of a battery can change much more than other components in a series of laptops because battery technology changes constantly and quickly.

#### Keyboard/Keys
The keyboard on a laptop is **typically smaller** than a traditional desktop keyboard. Laptop keyboards are located in the lower portion of the clamshell and can be either simple to remove in order to access the peripherals below or more involved and may entail removing numerous components to access the keyboard. 
The process of replacing a keyboard usually requires removing the screws and disconnecting the ribbon cable but with more integrated keyboards the process will be more complex. Always bring an external keyboard that can be connect by either Bluetooth or USB to work around a malfunctioning or broken keyboard.
The removal or replacement of a key cap is usually a delicate procedure as the mechanism for the key-switch is precise. 

#### Random-Access Memory 
[[RAM]] : The industry-standard form factor for RAM in laptops is the **[Small Outline Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)]**. When replacing a SODIMM, ensure that the SODIMM is compatible with the motherboard. SODIMMs can be 200-pin DDR and DDR2, 204-pin DDR3, 260-pin DDR4, or 262-pin DDR5, and they can be 32-bit or 64-bit configurations. The RAM is located in the bottom of the clamshell.

#### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)/Solid State Drive (SSD) Migration
After HDD or SSD replacement, data stored on the old drive may need to be migrated to the new drive. Migration can be done either **manually** or through the use of **migration software**. Manual migration is typically preferable when only user data needs to be migrated. Before replacement, move all data to a separate location, such as the cloud or external device, and copy the data to the new drive once installed. Manual migration does not move user settings or configurations. Migration software can be used to move files, settings configurations, and applications from one drive to another. Typically, **both drives need to be accessible** for migration software to work.

#### HDD/SSD Replacement
HDDs and SSDs for laptops come in **three possible form factors**: 2.5”, 1.8”, or M.2. Most laptops use SSDs to save space and most laptops have a single cable connecting the drive to the laptop, providing both data and power to the drive. The drive will be located in the bottom of the clamshell. Remove the bottom cover, locate the drive, remove any screws (between one and four, typically), disconnect the SATA cable, and replace.

#### Wireless Cards
The wireless **[[Motherboards#NIC|NIC]]** allows for wireless communication between the laptop and wireless access points. The wireless NIC is located in the bottom of the clamshell. Remove the bottom cover, remove the screw holding the wireless NIC in place, disconnect the two antenna wires, and pull straight out of the M.2 socket. Replace by reversing the procedure.

## Smart Phones
Smartphones differ from laptops in that they run special operating systems that are designed for mobile devices. Examples of these operating systems are Google's Android and Apple's iOS. Smartphones may have limited OS upgradeability, so they can become out-of-date and require a purchase of a new phone to take advantage of new features of the OS and apps that require a higher OS version. Software for smartphones is usually limited to apps that can be downloaded from stores such as Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Smartphones are very compact and quite powerful. They have small touch screens with no physical keyboard. The keyboard is displayed on the screen. Because they are so small, they are usually limited to only one or two types of physical connection such as USB and headphones.

Smartphones use cellular connectivity options for voice, text, and data services. Other data connections include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

### Features
An additional feature of smartphones is location services. Most phones include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] functionality. A GPS receiver in the phone uses satellites to determine the geographic location of the device. This allows the device location to be used by apps for various purposes such as social media updates or receiving offers from nearby businesses. Some apps allow a smartphone to act as a navigational GPS that provides guidance for driving, biking, or walking. If the GPS is off, most smartphones can still determine the location, in a less precise way, by using info coming from nearby mobile service antennas or nearby Wi-Fi access points.

Another feature of some smartphones is the ability to "tether", or share, the cellular data connection with other devices. The smartphone can be configured to act as a modem that provides other devices to the cellular data network over USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi. Not all smartphone carriers permit tethering.

## Tablets
Tablets are similar to smartphones in that they use special mobile operating systems like Android or iOS. However, most tablets do not have the ability to access cellular networks. Some higher-end models do allow access to cellular services.

Unlike smartphones, tablets normally have larger touch-screen displays. The displays are often quite vivid in their graphic rendering. Tablets usually offer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and most have USB and audio ports. In addition, some tablets include GPS receivers that can be activated to provide location services, similar to smartphones. Most of the apps that work on phones are also available for tablets.

## E-reader
E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, are special purpose devices with black and white displays that have been optimized for reading text. Although they resemble tablets, they lack many of the features and functions that tablets provide. Web access is limited to eBook stores that may be operated by the e-reader manufacturer. Many have touch displays that make it easy to turn pages, change settings, and access eBooks online. Many E-readers can store 1,000 or more books. For connectivity, some offer free cellular data connections for downloading books from a specific store, but most rely on Wi-Fi. Bluetooth is also available and supports headphones for audio books. E-reader battery life is usually longer than tablets, at up 15-20 hours of reading time or more. 

## Wearables

### Physical Privacy and Security Components
designed to prevent the loss of information through physical means such as shoulder surfing or theft.

#### Biometrics
the use of a **physical body part** to enhance security. Commonly used biometrics are **facial recognition** or a **fingerprint scanner** with older models. Biometrics can also be added to a laptop as a peripheral device via a USB port.

#### Near-Field Scanner Features
[NFC] A wireless communication method that sends signals between compatible devices in close proximity, up to 10 cm, to another NFC compatible device. NFC scanners are often used for wireless payments and can be intercepted by malicious devices in close proximity. Be aware of surroundings and suspicious electronic devices when using NFC.

## Mobile Device Components
perform the same functions as desktop components and control input and output, processing, storage, display, and connection capabilities. _Note:_ You must be able to **compare and contrast** mobile device components for the exam.

### Types
There are **two primary types** of mobile display units: liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode.

#### Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
LCD is a display technology that uses a current passed through a semi-crystalline liquid to produce images. The liquid crystals do not produce light and require a light source, the backlight, to display the image. _Note:_ If a device states that it is LED, it uses LCD technology with an LED backlight. There are **three popular variants** of LCDs: IPS, TN, and VA, all of which use liquid crystals and transistors to form patterns in different ways.

**In-plane switching (IPS)**—IPS offers the widest viewing angle and the best color reproduction. Ideal for vertical mounting and those needing high-quality color, such as graphic and video artists.

**Twisted nematic (TN)**—As the oldest of the LCD technologies, TN has limited viewing angles and washed out or blended color reproduction. Minimal lag time makes them ideal for competitive gamers and they are an inexpensive option for office use.

**Vertical alignment (VA)**—VA offers the best contrast ratio of the three technologies and is a solid middle ground choice with decent color reproduction and only a slight lag.

#### Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED)
OLED displays contain both the image-producing components and the light source in a **single panel**. An organic light-emitting compound is sandwiched between an anode and a cathode which produces a current. The current runs through the electroluminescent compound producing light. The structure of OLEDs allows them to be flexible for curved displays. **Power consumption** with an OLED is less than with an LCD, and the **contrast ratio** is higher, producing sharper images. OLED is popular in high-end monitors and smaller devices such as smartphones.

### Display Components
Besides the display unit, mobile device components contained in the top part of the clamshell include the backlight (for LCDs), the inverter (for LCDs), the screen (LCD or OLED), the digitizer (if applicable), the webcam, the microphone, and the Wi-Fi antenna.

### Wi-Fi Antenna Connector/Placement

The Wi-Fi antenna is generally located in the top of the clamshell case so as to place the antenna higher up for better signal reception. The antenna will be connected to the motherboard by running the wire from the top of the clamshell, through the hinge, and into the bottom of the clamshell to the motherboard.

### Camera/Webcam
The most common placement for a webcam or camera is in the center at the top of the clamshell above the display. Most laptops also include a built-in light next to the webcam to illuminate the user.

### Microphone
The microphone can be placed either next to the webcam and light in the top of the clamshell, or in the bottom of the clamshell, depending on the model of the laptop.

### Touch Screen/Digitizer
A digitizer is a device that takes analog input in the form of written or drawn content, such as by a finger or stylus, and converts it into digital images. The digitizer, commonly called a touchscreen, can be **built into** the display as the top glass sheet or as an **overlay** for the display screen.

### Inverter
An inverter is a small circuit board located behind an LCD panel that turns DC current into the AC current which is needed by the backlight of the LCD display. Flickering screens and dimness are common signs of inverter malfunction.

## Mobile Device Accessories and Ports

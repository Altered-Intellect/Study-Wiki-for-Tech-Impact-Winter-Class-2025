A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a private network that uses a public network (usually the internet) to connect remote sites or users together. Instead of using a dedicated leased line, a VPN uses "virtual" connections routed through the internet from the company's private network to the remote site or employee.

Many companies create their own VPNs to accommodate the needs of remote employees and distant offices. With the proliferation of mobile devices, it was a natural move to add VPN clients to smartphones and tablets.

When a VPN is established from a client to a server, the client accesses the network behind the server as if it was connected directly to that network. Because VPN protocols also allow for data encryption, the communication between client and server is secure.

When the VPN information has been added to the device, that device must be started before traffic can be sent and received through it.

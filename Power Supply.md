The following describes the various computer desktop power supply form factors that have evolved over time:

- **Advanced Technology (AT)** – This is the original power supply for legacy computer systems now considered obsolete.
- **AT Extended (ATX)** – This is the updated version of the AT but still considered to be obsolete.
- **ATX12V** – This is the most common power supply on the market today. It includes a second motherboard connector to provide dedicated power to the CPU. There are several versions of ATX12V available.
- **EPS12V** – This was originally designed for network servers but is now commonly used in high-end desktop models.

### Voltage
The different connectors also provide different voltages. The most common voltages supplied are 3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts. The 3.3 volt and 5 volt supplies are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12 volt supply is used to run motors in disk drives and fans.

Power supplies can also be single rail, dual rail, or multi rail. A rail is the printed circuit board (PCB) inside the power supply to which the external cables are connected. A single rail has all of the connectors connected to the same PCB while a multi rail PCB has separate PCBs for each connector.

A computer can tolerate slight fluctuations in power, but a significant deviation can cause the power supply to fail.

#### Input 110-120 VAC vs. 220-240 VAC
The input to a power supply is provided by the power company. This is the power available at a wall outlet. In North America and some other parts of the world, **110 volts AC - 120 volts AC** is supplied. Other countries supply **220 volts AC - 240 volts AC**. So, power supplies are designed to accept either or both of these inputs. On the back of some power supplies is a small switch called the voltage selector switch, as shown in the image. This switch sets the input voltage to the power supply to either 110V/115V or 220V/230V. A power supply with this switch is called a dual voltage power supply. You may find power supplies that accept only one or the other voltage, but most accept both.
**CAUTION**: Do not open a power supply. Electronic capacitors located inside of a power supply can hold a charge for extended periods of time.

#### Output 3.3V vs. 5V vs. 12V
The power supply **converts the AC power input to DC power** that supplies the computer’s components. Most power supplies provide +5V and +12V. Others may also provide -12V, -5V, and +3.3V. You may see more than one connector for a specific output. For example, you may see two +12V outputs, each with its own connector. Each output is called a **rail**, so in this example, there would be two +12V rails.

### 20-Pin to 24-Pin Motherboard Adapter
Most power supplies provide DC output power on a standard 24-pin connector, also called the **ATX power connector**, which plugs into the motherboard. The connector is keyed so that it can only plug in one way, ensuring that the proper voltages are supplied to the right pins. Specific pins are designated to supply +5V, +12V, -12V, and 3.3V.

### Redundant Power Supply
A redundant power supply is a **secondary power supply** that provides power to a device in case of power failure.

### Modular Power Supply
A modular power supply is a power supply that is **not permanently attached** to the device. This provides the potential for additional power connections to the device.

### Wattage Rating
Wattage rating, or **power rating**, is the total capacity of the power supply. This must be high enough to meet the total power demands of all components in the computer. The number and **types of devices or components** in any given computer determine what wattage rating is needed for the power supply. They also determine what **types of connectors** are needed to ensure that you can connect the power supply to each device. The **type of case** the computer is in also needs to be considered to ensure that the power supply physically fits properly.

To determine the wattage requirement of the power supply, add all of the wattage ratings of the individual components. Your power supply’s wattage must meet or preferably exceed that total value. The connectors needed are determined by the connector types used on the devices to be powered. For example, if you have an older ATX motherboard, it has a 20-pin power connection, while newer models contain the 24-pin Molex power connection.

The power supply you select obviously must physically fit into the case. It also needs long enough cables from the power supply to reach the components.

| Required Wattage    | Add the wattage for each component. If the wattage is not listed on a component, calculate it by multiplying its voltage and amperage. If the component requires different levels of wattage, use that higher requirement |
| # of components     | Make sure the power supply provides enough wattage to support the # and types of components plus another 25% at minimum                                                                                                   |

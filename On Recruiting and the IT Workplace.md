## Personal Anecdotes
1. Tabitha lost three people in her life in a short amount of time while moving to a new job. During this transition she was closed off and not as engaged socially with her coworkers. One coworker complained about her conduct and unfairly assumed she was judging and being unfriendly. Instead of escalating the situation, she explained her situation and opened up to her coworkers overtime and showing the coworker some "spiteful kindness".
2. A manager was taking credit for work he did not do, Tabitha filed a complaint with her boss who tried brushing the situation off, insisting it would not be worth it. She instead went to his boss and present the facts of the situation. The manger in question got properly reprimanded with no risk to her job.
3. Interviewed a guy in cargo short and a Hawaiian print shirt. He ended up getting the job, and on the first day he wore an Indiana style hat and a black leather trench coat. He still has his job and works remotely and night shifts.
4. A batch of Dell laptops were made with faulty fans. This was only figured out through investigating several tickets on the laptops. They ordered a bunch of replacement fans so they could replace them immediately. 
5. A person she placed in a job in Nashville talked about her reputation when they were moved to California
6. Tabitha's involvement with tech impact has come full circle with a graduate solving a problem she had with her laptop

# Terms
- **Pixel** - Abbreviation for “picture element” and is a tiny dot capable of displaying the shades red, green, and blue (RGB). More pixels mean the monitor can display more detail.
- **Dot Pitch** - This is the distance between pixels on the screen. A lower dot pitch (i.e., a smaller distance between dots) produces a better image.
- **Brightness** - Describes the luminance of a monitor measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m2). Brightness up to 250 cd/m2 is typically recommended, however, in well-lit rooms, use up to 350 cd/m2. Too much brightness may cause eyestrain.
- **Contrast Ratio** - This is a measurement of how white and how black a monitor can get. A contrast ratio of 1,000:1 displays dimmer whites and more pale blacks than 4,500:1.
- **Aspect Ratio** - the horizontal to vertical measurement of the viewing area of a monitor. For example, QSXGA measures 2,560 pixels horizontally by 2,048 pixels vertically, which creates an aspect ratio of 5:4. If a viewing area was 16 inches wide by 12 inches high, then the aspect ratio would be 4:3. A viewing area that is 24 inches wide by 18 inches high also has an aspect ratio of 4:3.
- **Refresh Rate** - Expressed in Hertz (Hz) and refers to how often per second your monitor can redraw the screen.
- **Response time** - The amount in time for a pixel to change properties (i.e., color or brightness). Fast response times display a smooth image when displaying fast action.
- **Frames Per Second** (FPS) - FPS is is how many times the computer is creating each frame. The higher the FPS, the better, but the monitor must be able to display the frames at the high rate.
- **Interlaced/Non-Interlaced** - Interlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen two times. The first scan covers the odd lines, top to bottom, and the second scan covers the even lines. Non-interlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen, one line at a time from top to bottom. 

**Note**: If you want to display more things on the screen, then select a higher resolution monitor. If you just want things to appear bigger, then select a larger screen size.

### Display Standards

| Standard | Resolution  | Aspect Ratio | Desc.                                                                             |

### Multiple Monitors
Adding monitors can increase your visual desktop area and improve productivity. The added monitors enable you to expand the size of the monitor or duplicate the desktop so you can view additional windows. For example, a user may use multiple displays. She is using the right monitor to make changes to a website and the left monitor to display the resulting change. She is also using a laptop to display a library of images she is considering for inclusion in the website.

Many computers have built-in support for multiple monitors. To connect multiple monitors to a computer, you need the supporting cables. Then you need to enable your computer to support multiple monitors. For example, on a Windows 10 host, right-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose **Display settings**. This should open the Display window.

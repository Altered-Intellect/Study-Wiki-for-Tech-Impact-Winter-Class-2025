do not spam or write long paragraphs, omit details that can be communicated later in a call or email
## E-mail

emails are professional documents and are automatically documented and archived, treat them as such
try and find information before sending an email, it should be the first method of communication and the last step in trying to obtain information
### Clarity

emails are flat, use punctuation when appropriate
no strange fonts
### Conciseness
simple wording
vary sentence length
stay on topic 
don not repeat yourself
### Organization
tailor words to audience
generalize and detail where necessary 
bullet point details, only subject no intro or conclusion

# [[Hardware]]
1. What is a Form Factor? What are some common desktop form factors? (1.2.1.1)
 The size and shape of the motherboard and the case that the computers components are put into. Common form factors include all-in-one, compact, full-size, and horizontal.

2. What is the purpose of a computer power supply? How does it function? (1.2.1.2) 
 The purpose of the power supply is to supply electrical power to the computer by converting the AC power of the power grid to the lower voltage DC required for computer components. 
 
3. What are the six power connectors described in the Cisco curriculum? What are the most common voltage units supplied by the Power Supply? (1.2.1.3 – 1.2.1.4)
20/24 pin, molex, 4/8 pin, 6/8 pin, SATA, and Berg Keyed connectors. 3.3, 5, and 12v.
  
4. How can ESD affect computer components? What are two precautions a tech can use to reduce this risk? (1.1.2.2) 
ESD is caused by the discharge of an electric charge with a lot of voltage. When a computer component is exposed to ESD it over-volts the circuitry and prevents it from properly holding a charge. ESD can be reduced by wear anti-static equipment such as mats, and wrist straps, removing metal from the body like jewelry, as well as self grounding via contact with a metal surface such as the computer case or metal furniture.

5. Fill in the blank: _______________ is a name for the circuits on the motherboard that control how system hardware interacts with the CPU and motherboard. 
PC Chipset

6. Generally, what components do the Northbridge and Southbridge chipsets control?(1.2.2.3)
The northbridge controls the timing and operation of faster components like the RAM, CPU, and graphics card, while the southbridge controls slower components such as input peripherals, USB, expansion slots, and the BIOS.

7. What are the two features make up a Motherboard Form Factor? What are the three common motherboard Form Factors?(1.2.2.4)
The size and shape of the the board the components are attached to, the most common of which are ATX, Micro-ATX, and ITX

8. Modern CPU sockets and processor packages are built around the following architectures:
 Pin Grid Array (PGA) in which the pins are on the processor itself, and Land Grid Array (LGA) in which the pins are on the socket instead.

9. What is ROM? What are PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM?(1.2.4.1-1.2.4.2) 
Read-Only-Memory
Programmable ROM
Erasable PROM
Electronically EPROM aka Flash ROMs
 
10. What is RAM and what is it used for? (1.2.4.1)  
Random Access Memory is used for temporary working storage of the computers which means the space is used to storage software and files that are currently being access to the CPU.

11. What type of RAM is typically used as cache memory, and what are some other features about it?(1.2.4.3)  
 Static RAM, its is typically faster than accessing the same information from the main memory or the DRAM.

12. Describe the main differences between DIP, SIMM, DIMM, and SODIMM memory
modules. (1.2.4.4)
Dual Inline Package is a single memory chip with two rows of pins.
Single Inline Memory Module is a single board with multiple chips with a single row of pins, usually 30 or 72.
Dual Inline Memory Module is a SIMM with two rows of pins.
Small Outline DIMM is a condensed version of a DIMM
 
13. What are the benefits of DDR4 SDRAM? (1.2.4.3) 
It has quadruple the storage of it previous iteration, decreases the voltage to 1.1v, and advanced ECC that can correct multiple errors.
 
14. What is parity memory and how does it differ from ECC memory? (1.2.4.4)
Parity data has a one bit every eight that is dedicated to error-checking, Error correcting code memory has dedicated space on the chip to both error-checking and error-correcting, but it can only do it a single bit at a time.

15. What is the purpose of expansion slots and adapter cards? And what are the most common expansion slots?
Expansion slots increase the functionality of a computer via connectors on the motherboard. Adapter cards add physical components to 
 
16. What are the three types of optical drives? What did these replace? (1.2.7.1)
CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray. Optical media
  
17. What are the benefits of an SSD over a traditional HDD?(1.2.6.4)   
SSDs are non volatile, meaning the memory does not require constant power to be stored, and the storage wears out slower because there is no moving parts, 
 
18. Name the three form factors SSD’s can take:
Tape Drives, M.2, Molex/PATA

19. Describe Virtual Reality. Describe Augmented Reality.(1.2.10.3) 
VR is an I/O system that used lenses and two displays to simulate an environment by blocking out the users immediate environment
 
20. What is NVMe? Why was it created? (1.2.6.4)
Non-Volatile Memory express is an open source standard for optimizing the transfer of data that uses the PCIe bus. It was created to connect SSDs to the motherboard via the PCIe bus without using specialized drivers.
 
21. What are the steps when disassembling a PC?(1.3.2.1)

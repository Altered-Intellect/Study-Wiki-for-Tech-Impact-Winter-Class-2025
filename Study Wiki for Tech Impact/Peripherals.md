# Input Devices
Input devices allow the user to communicate with a computer.

**Keyboard and Mouse**
These are the two most commonly used input devices. Keyboards are typically used for creating text documents and emails. The mouse is used to navigate the graphical user interface (GUI). Laptops also have touchpads to provide built-in keyboard and mouse features. The keyboard was the very first type of input device.

**ADF / Flatbed Scanner**
These devices digitize an image or document. A photograph or document is placed on the flat glass surface and the scan head then moves under the glass. The digitization of the image is stored as a file that can be displayed, printed, emailed, or altered. Some of these scanners have automatic document feeders (ADF) to support multiple page input.

**Joystick and Gamepad**
These are input devices for playing games. Gamepads allow the player to control movement and views with small sticks and multiple buttons. Many gamepads also have triggers that register the amount of pressure the player puts on them. Joysticks are often used to play flight simulation-style games.

**KVM Switch**
A keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) switch is a hardware device that can be used to control more than one computer while using a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse. For businesses, KVM switches provide cost-efficient access to multiple servers. Home users can save space using a KVM switch to connect multiple computers to one keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Some KVM switches have the capability to share USB devices and speakers with multiple computers.

**Touch screen**
These input devices have touch or pressure sensitive screens. The computer receives instructions specific to the place on the screen that the user touches.

**Stylus**
This device is a type of digitizer that allows a designer or artist to create blueprints, images, or other artwork by using a pen-like tool called a stylus on a surface that senses where the tip is touching it. Some digitizers have more than one surface, or sensor, and allow the user to create 3D models by performing actions with the stylus in mid-air. 

**Magnetic Stripe Reader**
Also called a magstripe reader, this device reads information magnetically encoded on the back of plastic cards, such as identification badges or credit cards.  
Also shown at the top of the device is a chip reader. For cards with chips, the card is inserted into the device and the device reads the chip. Chip reading provides much more security of the user's data because each transaction is a unique code that cannot be used again. 

**Barcode Scanner**
This type of scanner, also called a price scanner, reads the information contained in the barcodes affixed to most products. They can be hand-held, wireless devices, or a stationary device. The light source on the reader captures the barcode image and translates the image into computer readable content. This device is typically used at checkout counters in stores or for determining inventory levels.

**Digital Camera**
These input devices capture images and videos that can be stored, displayed, printed, or altered.

**Webcam**
These devices are video cameras that can be integrated into a computer or they can be external. They are typically used for video conferencing or to stream live video onto the internet.

**Signature Pad**
This is a device that electronically captures a person’s signature. A person uses a stylus to sign on the screen. Since the electronic signature is legal, it is typically used to establish receipt of deliveries or to sign agreements or contracts.

**Smart Card Reader**
These input devices are typically used on a computer to authenticate the user. A smart card may be the size of a credit card with an embedded integrated circuit that is typically under a gold contact pad on one side of the card.

**Microphone**
This device is a type of digitizer that allows a user to speak into a computer and have their voice digitized. Voice, music, or sounds can be stored on the computer to be played back, uploaded, or emailed. This device can also be used as input for games and communication software.

**NFC Devices and Terminals**
Near Field Communication tap to pay devices, such as credit cards or smart phones, are able to read and write to an NFC chip. This allows the NFC-powered terminal to subtract money from the balance on the card. Two NFC capable devices can also transfer data such as photographs, links, or contacts between them.

**Facial Recognition Scanners**
These biometric input devices identify a user based on their unique facial features. Many laptops and most smartphones have facial recognition scanners to automate logging in to the device. These devices are typically used to provide secure access to devices or locations.

**Fingerprint Scanners**
These biometric input devices identify a user based on a unique physical feature such as their fingerprints. Many laptops and smart devices have fingerprint readers to automate logging in to the device. These devices are typically used to provide secure access to devices or locations.

**Voice Recognition Scanners**
These biometric input devices identify a user based on their unique voice. These devices are often used to provide secure access to locations. Voice recognition is also being used as input into personal assistant applications such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa.

# Output Devices
An output device takes binary information from the computer and converts it into a form that is easily understood by the user.

Monitors and projectors are output devices that create visual and audio signals for the user. Virtual Reality (VR) headsets are another type of output device. Televisions may also be output devices. Printers are visual output devices that create hard copies of computer files.

## **Monitor**
Most monitors use one of three types of technology: LCD, LED, or OLED.  
Liquid crystal display (LCD) has two polarizing filters with a liquid crystal solution between them. An electronic current aligns the crystals so that light can pass through or not pass through, creating the image.  
Light-emitting diode (LED) is an LCD display that uses LED backlighting. LED has lower power consumption than standard LCD backlighting. The panel is thinner, lighter, brighter, and has better contrast than LCD.  
Organic LED (OLED) is a type of LED display that uses a layer of organic material which responds to electrical stimulus to emit light. Each pixel lights individually, resulting in much deeper black levels than LED.
There are many types of computer monitors available. Some are designed for casual use, while others are for specific requirements, such as those used by architects, graphic designers, or even gamers.

Monitors vary by use, size, quality, clarity, brightness and more. Therefore, it is useful to understand the various terms used when discussing monitors.

Computer monitors are usually described by:
- **Screen size** – This is the diagonal measurement of the screen (i.e., top left to bottom right) in inches. Common sizes include 19 to 24 inches, to ultrawide monitors that are 30 or more inches wide. Larger monitors are usually better but are more expensive and require more desk space.
- **Resolution** – Resolution is measured by the number of horizontal and vertical pixels. For example, 1920 x 1080 (i.e., 1080p) is a common resolution. This means it has 1920 horizontal pixels and 1080 vertical pixels.
- **Monitor resolution** – This relates to the amount of information that can be displayed on a screen. A higher resolution monitor displays more information on a screen than a lower resolution monitor does. This is true even with monitors that have the same screen size.
- **Native resolution** – This identifies the best monitor resolution for the specific monitor. In Windows 10, the native resolution of a monitor is identified using the keyword (Recommended) beside the monitor resolution. For example, in the figure, the native resolution of the monitor is 1920 x 1080.
- **Native mode** – This term describes when the image sent to the monitor by the video adapter card matches the native resolution of the monitor.
- **Connectivity** – Older monitors used VGA or DVI connectors while newer monitors support HDMI and DisplayPort ports. DisplayPort is a connection found on newer monitors. It supports higher resolutions and high refresh rates.

### Terms
- **Pixel** - Abbreviation for “picture element” and is a tiny dot capable of displaying the shades red, green, and blue (RGB). More pixels mean the monitor can display more detail.
- **Dot Pitch** - This is the distance between pixels on the screen. A lower dot pitch (i.e., a smaller distance between dots) produces a better image.
- **Brightness** - Describes the luminance of a monitor measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m2). Brightness up to 250 cd/m2 is typically recommended, however, in well-lit rooms, use up to 350 cd/m2. Too much brightness may cause eyestrain.
- **Contrast Ratio** - This is a measurement of how white and how black a monitor can get. A contrast ratio of 1,000:1 displays dimmer whites and more pale blacks than 4,500:1.
- **Aspect Ratio** - the horizontal to vertical measurement of the viewing area of a monitor. For example, QSXGA measures 2,560 pixels horizontally by 2,048 pixels vertically, which creates an aspect ratio of 5:4. If a viewing area was 16 inches wide by 12 inches high, then the aspect ratio would be 4:3. A viewing area that is 24 inches wide by 18 inches high also has an aspect ratio of 4:3.
- **Refresh Rate** - Expressed in Hertz (Hz) and refers to how often per second your monitor can redraw the screen.
- **Response time** - The amount in time for a pixel to change properties (i.e., color or brightness). Fast response times display a smooth image when displaying fast action.
- **Frames Per Second** (FPS) - FPS is is how many times the computer is creating each frame. The higher the FPS, the better, but the monitor must be able to display the frames at the high rate.
- **Interlaced/Non-Interlaced** - Interlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen two times. The first scan covers the odd lines, top to bottom, and the second scan covers the even lines. Non-interlaced monitors create the image by scanning the screen, one line at a time from top to bottom.

**Note**: If you want to display more things on the screen, then select a higher resolution monitor. If you just want things to appear bigger, then select a larger screen size.

### Multiple Monitors
Adding monitors can increase your visual desktop area and improve productivity. The added monitors enable you to expand the size of the monitor or duplicate the desktop so you can view additional windows. For example, the woman in the figure below is using multiple displays. She is using the right monitor to make changes to a website and the left monitor to display the resulting change. She is also using a laptop to display a library of images she is considering for inclusion in the website.

Many computers have built-in support for multiple monitors. To connect multiple monitors to a computer, you need the supporting cables. Then you need to enable your computer to support multiple monitors. For example, on a Windows 10 host, right-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose **Display settings**. This should open the Display window.

## **Projector**
Most video projectors use LCD or DLP technology. DLP stands for Digital Light Processing. DLP uses a spinning color wheel with an array of mirrors. Each mirror corresponds to a pixel and reflects light toward or away from the projector optics, creating an image of up to 1024 shades of gray. The color wheel then adds the color data to complete the projected image.  
Different projectors have different numbers of lumens, which affects the level of brightness of the projected image. LCD projectors typically have more lumens (brighter) than DLP projectors. ANSI has a standardized procedure for testing projectors. Projectors tested with this procedure are quoted in "ANSI lumens". Projectors can be easily compared on the basis of their brightness specifications.  
Brightness (white light output) measures the total amount of light projected in lumens. The color brightness specification measures red, green, and blue using the same approach used to measure brightness.

## Speakers
Speakers are a type of auditory output device. Most computers and mobile devices have audio support either integrated into the motherboard or on an adapter card. Audio support includes ports that allow input and output of audio signals. The audio card has an amplifier to power headphones and external speakers.

## Headphones
Headphones, earbuds, and the earphones found in headsets are all auditory output devices. These may be wired or wireless. Some are Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-enabled.

# Input/Output Devices

## Virtual Reality Headset
uses computer technology to create a simulated, three-dimensional environment. The user feels immersed in this ‘virtual world’ and manipulates it. A VR headset completely encases the upper portion of users’ faces, not allowing in any ambient light from their surroundings. Most VR experiences have three-dimensional images that seem life-sized to the user. VR experiences also track a user's motions, and adjust the images on the user's display accordingly.
These devices are typically used with computer games, simulators, and training applications. They are head-mounted devices that provide separate images for each eye. Most headsets include head-motion and eye-motion tracking sensors. These devices are also output devices delivering video and audio to the wearer. 
VR headsets can have specific hardware and software platforms. They may be tethered to a controller, standalone, or mobile. They may have a variety of sensors including motion, external visual positioning, camera(s), motion tracking, accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. Resolution and refresh rates vary.

## Augmented Reality (AR)
uses similar technology but superimposes images and audio over the real world in real time. AR can provide users with immediate access to information about their real surroundings. An AR headset usually does not close off ambient light to users, allowing them to see their real life surroundings. Not all AR requires a headset. Some AR can simply be downloaded onto a smart phone. Pokemon GO is an early version of an AR game that uses a player’s smart phone to ‘see and capture’ virtual objects in the real world. Other AR devices are smart glasses. They weigh much less than the headsets and are often designed for a specific audience, such as cyclists.
AR headsets and smart glasses come with a wide array of features. Most have a camera, motion sensors, GPS, a CPU, battery power, and a controller. Many also have storage, Bluetooth, speakers, and voice control. The Microsoft Hololens is a headset with an integrated holographic processing unit.

# Multi-Function Devices
You must be able to identify, deploy, and configure multi-function devices and printers with the appropriate setting. The questions about these concepts will be scenario based.

## [[Printers]]
Printers are output devices that create hard copies of files. A hard copy might be a on a sheet of paper. It could also be a plastic form created from a 3D printer.

Today’s printers may be wired, wireless, or both. They use different technology to create the image you see. All printers require printing material (such as ink, toner, liquid plastic, etc.) and a method to place it accurately on the paper or extrude it into the desired shape. All printers have hardware that must be maintained. Most printers also have software, in the form of drivers that must be kept up to date.

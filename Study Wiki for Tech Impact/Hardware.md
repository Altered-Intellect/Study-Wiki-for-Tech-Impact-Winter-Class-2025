Hardware concepts are one of the most heavily emphasized areas of IT assessed on the CompTIA A+ 1101 exam. Around **25%** of the questions on the test pertain to this area. You’ll need to be highly competent in identifying, using, and connecting hardware components and devices. The recent increase in remote work also makes it necessary to know about different devices that support that workforce. As you study, keep in mind that nearly all the questions (**86%**) about hardware will begin with a **scenario**.

## [[Cabling and Ports]]

## [[Computational Memory]]
Internal components that store binary information that is used in the computations that a computer executes.
## [[Storage]]
The physical components used to store data and files that a computer system needs to operate. A number of different types of devices are available for data storage on a PC. Data drives provide non-volatile storage of data, meaning that when the drive loses power, the data is retained and available the next time the drive is powered on. Some drives have fixed media, and other drives have removable media. Some offer the ability to read and write data, while others only allow data to be accessed, but not written. Data storage devices can be classified according to the media on which the data is stored; magnetic like HDD and tape drives, solid state, or optical.
You must be able to identify and install different storage devices. Questions about these will be scenario based.

## [[Cases]]
The case of a desktop computer houses the internal components such as the power supply, motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), memory, disk drives, and assorted adapter cards.  
Cases are typically made of plastic, steel, or aluminum and provide the framework to support, protect, and cool the internal components. A device form factor refers to its physical design and look. Desktop computers are available in a variety of form factors including: 

## [[Power Supply]]
Electricity from wall outlets is provided in alternating current (AC). However, all components inside a computer require direct current (DC) power. To obtain DC power, computers use a power supply, to convert AC power into a lower voltage DC power. There are different types of power supplies to fit different types of computers. Each power supply has specific features related to capacity and connectors. You must be able to select the proper power supply type and features needed in any given scenario.

## [[Motherboards]]
The motherboard, also known as the system board or the main board, is the backbone of the computer. It provides the circuitry by which all parts of a computer communicate with each other, from the processor to the power supply. Every part of a computer interacts with the motherboard in some fashion. You should be able to install and configure motherboards, as well as the CPUs and add-on cards you plug into them, in a given scenario.
a motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains buses, or electrical pathways, that interconnect electronic components. These components may be soldered directly to the motherboard, or added using sockets, expansion slots, and ports.

## [[Peripherals]]

### Use Appropriate Drivers for the OS
Most devices will come with **easy installation media**. Windows devices will automatically recognize a device upon connection and powerup. Install the appropriate **driver** for the OS and the device. Install any **updates** for the appropriate drivers.

# Study Questions
1. What is a Form Factor? What are some common desktop form factors? (1.2.1.1)
 The size and shape of the motherboard and the case that the computers components are put into. Some form factors include all-in-one, compact, full-size, and horizontal.

1. What is the purpose of a computer power supply? How does it function? (1.2.1.2) 
 The purpose of the power supply is to supply electrical power to the computer by converting the AC power of the power grid to the DC required for computer components. 
 
1. What are the six power connectors described in the Cisco curriculum? What are the most common
voltage units supplied by the Power Supply? (1.2.1.3 – 1.2.1.4)
20/24 pin, molex, 4/8 pin, 6/8 pin, SATA, and Berg Keyed connectors. 3.3, 5, and 12v
  
1. How can ESD affect computer components? What are two precautions a tech can use to reduce
this risk?(1.1.2.2) 
ESD is caused by the discharge of an electric charge with a lot of voltage. When a computer component is exposed to ESD it over-volts the circuitry and prevents it from properly holding a charge. ESD can be reduced by wear anti-static equipment such as mats, and wrist straps, as well as self ground via contact with a metal surface such as the computer case or metal furniture.

5. Fill in the blank: _______________ is a name for the circuits on the motherboard that control
how system hardware interacts with the CPU and motherboard. 
Chipset

6. Generally, what components do the Northbridge and Southbridge chipsets control?(1.2.2.3)
The northbridge controls the timing and operation of faster components like the RAM, CPU, and graphics card, while the southbridge controls slower components such as input peripherals, USB, expansion slots, and the BIOS.

7. What are the two features make up a Motherboard Form Factor? What are the three common
motherboard Form Factors?(1.2.2.4)
The size and shape of the the board the components are attached to. ATX, Micro-ATX, and ITX

8. Modern CPU sockets and processor packages are built around the following architectures:
 Pin Grid Array (PGA) in which the pins are on the processor itself, and Land Grid Array (LGA) in which the pins are on the socket instead.

9. What is ROM? What are PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM?(1.2.4.1-1.2.4.2) 
Read-Only-Memory
Programmable ROM
Erasable PROM
Electronically EPROM
 
10. What is RAM and what is it used for?(1.2.4.1)  
Random Access Memory is used for temporary working storage of the computers which means the space is used to storage software and files that are currently running.

11. What type of RAM is typically used as cache memory, and what are some other features about
it?(1.2.4.3)  
 Static RAM, its is typically faster than accessing the same information from the main memory or the DRAM.

12. Describe the main differences between DIP, SIMM, DIMM, and SODIMM memory
modules.(1.2.4.4)

 
13. What are the benefits of DDR4 SDRAM?(1.2.4.3) 
It has quadruple the storage of it previous iteration, decreases the voltage to 1.1v, and advanced ECC that can correct multiple errors.
 
14. What is parity memory and how does it differ from ECC memory?(1.2.4.4)
 Parity data has a one bit every eight that is dedicated to error-checking, Error correcting code memory has dedicated space on the chip to both error-checking and error-correcting, but it can only do it a single bit at a time.

15. What is the purpose of expansion slots and adapter cards? And what are the most common
expansion slots?

 
16. What are the three types of optical drives? What did these replace?(1.2.7.1)

  
17. What are the benefits of an SSD over a traditional HDD?(1.2.6.4)   

 
18. Name the three form factors SSD’s can take:


19. Describe Virtual Reality. Describe Augmented Reality.(1.2.10.3) 

 
20. What is NVMe? Why was it created?(1.2.6.4)

 
21. What are the steps when disassembling a PC?(1.3.2.1)

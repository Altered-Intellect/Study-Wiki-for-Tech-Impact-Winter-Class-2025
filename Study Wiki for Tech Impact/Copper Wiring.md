# Cat Cabling 
**Cat 5**—**Category 5** cables have a transmission rate of up to 100 Mbps over a max distance of 100 meters.

**Cat 5e**—**Category 5e** cables have a transmission rate of up to 1 Gbps over a max distance of 100 meters due to the separation of the four sets of twisted pairs from one another and an increased number of twists in the cable pairs. This results in less interference.

**Cat 6**—**Category 6** cables have a transmission rate of up to 10 Gbps over a max distance of 55 meters.

**Cat 6a**—**Category 6a** cables have a transmission rate of up to 10 Gbps but have an increased distance capability of up to 100 meters.

## **Coaxial**
A **coaxial cable** is a single copper-cored cable contained in an inner insulation layer. This inner layer is further contained in a wire mesh conductor. The entire cable is then further protected in an outer insulation layer. Coaxial cables are not as commonly used in modern networks, but some usage may still be seen with cable and satellite devices. Coaxial cables are specified by the **Radio Guide (RG) system**. For the purpose of the test, you need to be familiar with **RG-6**, which is made of a solid copper core used with satellite/cable modems, and **RG-59**, which is made of a solid copper core and used for cable television.

**Coax Cable Construction** Coax cable with the outer jacket pulled back to reveal the braided shielding and copper core conductor.

**RG-6** RG-6 cable is heavy gauge and has insulation and shielding tuned for high-bandwidth, high-frequency applications such as Internet, Cable TV, and Satellite TV signals. RG-6 commonly uses an F-Type connector, as shown in the figure.

**RG-59** RG-59 cable is thinner than RG-6 and has less shielding. RG-59 is recommended in low bandwidth and lower frequency applications such as analog video and CCTV applications. RG-59 commonly uses a BNC connector as shown in the next figure.

**BNC** BNC connectors connect coaxial cables to devices using a quarter-turn connection scheme. BNC is used with digital or analog audio, or video.

## Twisted Copper Pair
A twisted copper pair is a twisted pair cable made of copper. The cable consists of pairs of individual wires twisted into pairs that are then twisted together. The cable is contained within an insulated jacket. **Ethernet cables** are twisted pairs. There are two types of twisted copper pairs: shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP). The twisting of wire pairs helps reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction.

**RJ-11 Connector** Older telephone networks used a four-wire UTP cable with two wire pairs terminated with a 6-pin RJ-11 connector. The RJ-11 connector looks very similar to the RJ-45 connector but is smaller.

**RJ-45 Connector** Each end of a UTP cable must be terminated with a connector. In the case of Ethernet networks, it is an RJ-45 connector that terminates the cable and is plugged into an Ethernet port.

## Unshielded Twisted Pair
An unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is made of two to four pairs of twisted wires. The pairs of wires in UTP cables are twisted in direct contact with one another. Each wire in twisted pairs is contained within an insulating layer, preventing copper from directly touching copper.

## Shielded Twisted Pair
A shielded twisted pair (STP) is made of two to four pairs of twisted wires. Each pair is contained in a layer of braided foil sheathing before being twisted with the other pairs in the cable. This reduces electrical interference. STP is used in Cat 7 and Cat 8 cables.

**Direct burial**
the practice of burying cables underground. Direct burial cables should be STP cables with an extra waterproof sheathing. It is recommended that direct burial be between six and eight inches underground in a protective PVC pipe and placed away from any other lines that contain electrical current.

#### Plenum
Plenum is a **Teflon-type covering** used to cover all types of network cables. Plenum is used in cables that may be exposed to extreme heat or have the possibility of releasing gasses into a ventilation system, such as in ceilings.

# Cat Cabling 
**Cat 5**—**Category 5** cables have a transmission rate of up to 100 Mbps over a max distance of 100 meters.
**Cat 5e**—**Category 5e** cables have a transmission rate of up to 1 Gbps over a max distance of 100 meters due to the separation of the four sets of twisted pairs from one another and an increased number of twists in the cable pairs. This results in less interference.
**Cat 6**—**Category 6** cables have a transmission rate of up to 10 Gbps over a max distance of 55 meters.
**Cat 6a**—**Category 6a** cables have a transmission rate of up to 10 Gbps but have an increased distance capability of up to 100 meters.

**Coaxial**—A **coaxial cable** is a single copper-cored cable contained in an inner insulation layer. This inner layer is further contained in a wire mesh conductor. The entire cable is then further protected in an outer insulation layer. Coaxial cables are not as commonly used in modern networks, but some usage may still be seen with cable and satellite devices. Coaxial cables are specified by the **Radio Guide (RG) system**. For the purpose of the test, you need to be familiar with **RG-6**, which is made of a solid copper core used with satellite/cable modems, and **RG-59**, which is made of a solid copper core and used for cable television.

## Twisted Copper Pair
A twisted copper pair is a twisted pair cable made of copper. The cable consists of pairs of individual wires twisted into pairs that are then twisted together. The cable is contained within an insulated jacket. **Ethernet cables** are twisted pairs. There are two types of twisted copper pairs: shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP).

## Unshielded Twisted Pair
An unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is made of two to four pairs of twisted wires. The pairs of wires in UTP cables are twisted in direct contact with one another. Each wire in twisted pairs is contained within an insulating layer, preventing copper from directly touching copper.

## Shielded Twisted Pair
A shielded twisted pair (STP) is made of two to four pairs of twisted wires. Each pair is contained in a layer of braided foil sheathing before being twisted with the other pairs in the cable. This reduces electrical interference. STP is used in Cat 7 and Cat 8 cables.

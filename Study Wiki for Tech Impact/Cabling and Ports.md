You must be able to describe different cable and their matching port types and their characteristics and uses, including connector types, features, and purposes.

# Network Cables
Network cables are used to connect devices such as computers to networking equipment. There are **three primary types** of network cable: **coaxial**, **twisted pair**, and **fiber**. A cable is the medium through which data is transferred from one device to another.

## [[Copper Wiring]]
Copper is the most common medium used in both coaxial and twisted-pair cables. Categories are used to describe performance ratings of twisted-pair cables. Commonly referred to as Cat cables, Category 1 through 8 exist, but for the purposes of the CompTIA A+ exam, we are only concerned with the **most common ratings, Category 5 through 6a**, and their corresponding transmission speeds and distance limitations. All Cat cables 2 through 8 are composed of four pairs of twisted-pairs totaling eight individual cables in one cable sheath.

**Direct burial**
the practice of burying cables underground. Direct burial cables should be STP cables with an extra waterproof sheathing. It is recommended that direct burial be between six and eight inches underground in a protective PVC pipe and placed away from any other lines that contain electrical current.

#### Plenum
Plenum is a **Teflon-type covering** used to cover all types of network cables. Plenum is used in cables that may be exposed to extreme heat or have the possibility of releasing gasses into a ventilation system, such as in ceilings.

## [[Optical Wiring]]
Optical is a transmission method that depends on light pulses for data transfer.

**Fiber**—Fiber refers to the small strings of flexible glass that are used for optical data transmission. Referred to as **fiber optic cables**, a fiber is surrounded by a rubberized coating and provides transmission speeds from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps over a max distance of several miles. Fiber is immune to both **electrical interference** and **wiretapping**. There are two basic types of fiber: single-mode and multimode. **Single-mode** fiber carries only one light path, typically sourced by a laser. **Multimode** carries multiple light paths and is sourced by an LED. Single-mode has a much longer transmission distance than multimode.

## T568A/T568B
Twisted pair wires are **color coded** for proper referencing. T568A and T568B are the two standards used for RJ-45 wiring connectors. The **T568A standard** is green/white, green, orange/white, blue, blue/white, orange, brown/white, and brown. The **T568B standard** is orange/white, orange, green/white, blue, blue/white, green, brown/white, and brown.

# Peripheral Cables
Peripheral cables attach peripheral devices to a computing device. Input/output (I/O) ports on a computer connect peripheral devices such as printers, scanners, and portable drives. In addition to the ports and interfaces, a computer may also have other ports. 

**USB 2.0**—The **USB 2.0** standard has a max speed of 480 Mbps and is referred to as **Hi-speed**.

**USB 3.0**—The **USB 3.0 standard** has a max speed of 5 Gbps and is referred to as **SuperSpeed**.

**Serial**—A **serial cable** is built for serial communications with a corresponding serial connector on the end. The most common serial connection type is **DB9**[1](https://uniontestprep.com/comptia-a-core-series-exam/study-guide/220-1101-hardware/pages/1#footnote_1), which has nine pins.

**Personal System 2 (PS/2)**—A PS/2 port connects a keyboard or a mouse to a computer. The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN female connector. The connectors for the keyboard and mouse are often colored differently. If the ports are not color-coded, look for a small figure of a mouse or keyboard next to each port.

**Thunderbolt**—Thunderbolt is a combination of PCI Express 2.0 x4 and DisplayPort 1.x technology. Thunderbolt was designed primarily for video transmission but can be used by other peripheral devices as well. There are **four Thunderbolt standards** labeled 1 to 4 with Thunderbolt 1 and 2 terminating in a Mini-DisplayPort connector and Thunderbolt 3 and 4 terminating in a USB-C connector.

# Video Ports and Cables
A video cable and port is designed to transmit data to visual display units, usually connecting a monitor to a computer. Video ports and monitor cables transfer analog signals, digital signals, or both. Computers are digital devices that create digital signals. The digital signals are sent to the graphics card where they are transmitted through a cable to a display.

**HDMI**—The **high-definition multimedia interface** cable is capable of handling higher motion-picture frame rates and digital audio on a single cable. The most common connector type for an HDMI cable is the **Standard A HDMI** cable which has 19 pins. HDMI was developed specifically for high-definition televisions. However, its digital features also make it a good candidate for computers.

**DP**—**DisplayPort** was developed to use less power than previous video cables. DisplayPort is backward compatible with VGA and DVI. DisplayPort is also capable of transmitting both video and audio signals. A standard DP cable has two hooks on it to lock the cable into place. It is an interface technology that is designed to connect high-end graphics-capable PCs and displays, as well as home theater equipment and displays.

**DVI**—The **digital visual interface** cable was developed to address the shortcomings of analog video transmission. DVI cables are capable of transmitting digital video signals to display units. The **three DVI connector standards** are DVI-A for analog connection only, DVI-D for digital connection only, and DVI-I for both analog and digital signals. DVI cables are typically white. The DVI connector is usually white and consists of as many as 24 pins (three rows of eight pins) for digital signals, up to 4 pins for analog signals, and a flat pin called a ground bar. DVI is disappearing as quickly as it appeared. It's still seen in some monitors alongside VGA, which is finally starting to fade in favor of HDMI.

**Radio Corporation of America (RCA)**—RCA connectors have a central plug with a ring around it and are used to carry audio or video. RCA connectors are often found in groups of three, where a yellow connector carries video and a pair of red and white connectors carries left and right audio channels.

**VGA**—The **video graphics array** cable is the oldest video standard still in use today. It has 3 rows and 15 pins. It is also sometimes referred to as the DE-15 or HD-15 connector. A VGA cable is **strictly analog** and is typically blue in color.

**Thunderbolt 1 or 2**—Thunderbolt allows for high-speed connection of peripherals such as hard drives, RAID arrays, network interfaces, and it can transmit high-definition video using the DisplayPort protocol.

**Thunderbolt 3**—uses the same connector as USB-C. It has twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2, uses less power, and can provide two 4K monitors with video.

# Hard Drive Cables
Hard drive cables/connectors connect internal components to the motherboard. Hard drive connections, known as **drive interfaces**, can be either **on-board or off-board**. Their attachment standard is based on the hard drive’s requirements and consists of circuitry and a header, or port.

**[[SATA]]**—**Serial Advanced Technology Attachment** is the **most common** type of drive interface. A standard SATA cable is internal and flat with an L-shaped **terminating connector** that can only fit into the motherboard connection port in one way. A SATA data cable has **seven pins**, while a SATA power cable has **15 pins**. SATA revisions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.2 support speeds of 1.5 Gbps, 3 Gbps, 6 Gbps, and 16 Gbps, respectively. This cable does not supply any power to the SATA device. A separate power cable provides power to the drive.

**[[SCSI]]**—**Small Computer System Interface** is a type of hard drive to motherboard connector that is most commonly used for **storage device connection**. SCSI cables can be either ribbon cables or round cables containing 50, 68, or 80 wires. Up to 16 devices, including the motherboard or SCSI controller card. It is an older standard that originally connected to one SCSI cable or **daisy-chained** together, used in parallel rather than serial, data transfers. A new version of SCSI known as Serially Attatched SCSI (SAS) has been developed and seen use in server storage.

**[[eSATA]]**—The **external SATA** cable, as the name suggests, is **external** to the housing. Standard eSATA cables are for data transmission only and do not provide power. An eSATA that provides power is called Power over eSATA, eSATA+, eSATAp, or eSATA/USB.

**[[IDE]]**—**Integrated drive electronics** cables, renamed **parallel advanced technology attachment (PATA)**, are a 34-pin or 40-pin ribbon cable with a colored strip along one edge to indicate the location of pin 1. There are three separate connectors on a PATA cable, one for power and two for drives. The 34-pin cable used for floppy drives and the 40-pin cable for hard drives and optical drives.

# Adapters
There are many connection standards in use today. Many are interoperable but require specialized components. These components are called adapters and converters
**Adapter** –This is a component that converts one type of connection or cable technology to another.
- **DVI-to-VGA**
- **DVI-to-HDMI**
- **USB-to-ethernet**
- **USB to PS/2**
- **Molex to SATA**

**Converter** – This performs the same function as an adapter but also translates the signals from one technology to the other. For example, a USB 3.0 to SATA converter enables a hard disk drive to be used as a flash drive.
- **HDMI to VGA converter**

# Connector Types
installed at the terminating points of cables to provide connection to compatible components and peripherals. The connector type used depends on the type of cable and the desired receptacle compatibility.

**Direction Dependency**—when a cable is asymmetric and is only able to be connected with a specific orientation
**Data Pins**—
**Power Pins**—

**RJ11**—A **registered jack (J)** is a **standard for telecommunication network interfaces** for voice and data equipment connection to a service provider or carrier. RJ11 is used with twisted pair cables to connect four to six wires to traditional telephone lines of modems.
**RJ45**—RJ45 is used with twisted pair cables for eight-wire connections. A twisted pair cable with RJ45 connectors is commonly called an **ethernet cable**.
**F-type**—An F-type connector (or just **F connector**) is used with coaxial cables for cable and satellite data connections.
**ST**—A **straight tip** connector is a **bayonet style** connector used with fiber optic cables.
**SC**—A **subscriber connector** is a push/pull-style connector used with fiber optic cables.
**LC**—A **lucent connector** is a push/pull-style connector used with fiber optic cables that is half the size of an SC, making it more suitable for office and data center usage.

**Punchdown block**—A punchdown block is an electrical connection device that allows for multiple copper wires to be “punched down” or inserted into a slot providing insulation as well as electrical connection to attached wires.
**Micro USB**—A micro USB connector is the **smallest** USB connector type, contains **five pins**, and is **direction dependent**.
**MiniUSB**—A mini USB is the **second smallest** USB connector type, contains **five pins**, and is **direction dependent**.
**USB-C**—USB-C is the most recent USB connector type containing **24 pins** in an **oval** shape, allowing for **reversible connection**.
**Molex™**—Molex is an older **two-piece** pin-and-socket interconnection type used for drive connections.
**Lightning port**—Lightning port is an **eight-pin Apple** proprietary connector type that has **reversible** orientation.
**DB9**—The DB9[1](https://uniontestprep.com/comptia-a-core-series-exam/study-guide/220-1101-hardware/pages/1#footnote_1) is a **trapezoid**-shaped nine-pin connector arranged in **two rows of four and five pins**. It is used for serial connections to network device consoles or management ports.
## Power Supply Connectors
These connectors are used to power various internal components such as the motherboard and disk drives. The connectors are “keyed” which means that they are designed to be inserted in only one orientation.

**A 20-pin or 24-pin slotted connector**
• Connects to the motherboard  
• The 24-pin connector has two rows of 12 pins each  
• The 20-pin connector has two rows of 10 pins each

**SATA keyed connector**
• Connects disk drives  
• Connector is wider and thinner than a Molex connector

**Molex keyed connector**
• Connects hard drives, optical drives, or other devices

**Berg keyed connector**
• Connect to legacy floppy drives  
• Smaller than a Molex connector

**4-pin to 8-pin auxiliary power connector**
• Connector has two rows of two to four pins and supplies power to different areas of the motherboard  
• The auxiliary power connector is the same shape as the main power connector but smaller

**6/8-pin PCIe power connector**
• Connector has two rows of three to four pins and supplies power to internal components

_1. The term “DB9” is commonly used but is technically incorrect; the proper name is “DE9,” referring to the size of the connector’s shell and the number of pins, with DE indicating a smaller shell size than DB. However, given that this misconception has been prevalent for so long in the industry, the CompTIA objectives use the term DB9._

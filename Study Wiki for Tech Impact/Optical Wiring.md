# Fiber
Refers to the small strings of flexible glass that are used for optical data transmission. Referred to as **fiber optic cables**, a fiber is surrounded by a rubberized coating and provides transmission speeds from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps over a max distance of several miles. Fiber is immune to both **electrical interference** and **wiretapping**. There are two basic types of fiber: single-mode and multimode. **Single-mode** fiber carries only one light path, typically sourced by a laser. **Multimode** carries multiple light paths and is sourced by an LED. Single-mode has a much longer transmission distance than multimode.

Optical fiber is composed of two kinds of glass (core and cladding) and a protective outer shield (jacket), as shown in the figure.

Because it uses light to transmit signals, fiber-optic cable is not affected by EMI or RFI. All signals are converted to light pulses as they enter the cable, and converted back into electrical signals when they leave it. This means that fiber-optic cable can deliver signals that are clearer, can go farther, and have greater bandwidth than cable made of copper or other metals. Although the optical fiber is very thin and susceptible to sharp bends, the properties of the core and cladding make it very strong. Optical fiber is durable and is deployed in harsh environmental conditions in networks all around the world.


## Types
**Single-mode fiber (SMF)**
Consists of a very small core and uses laser technology to send a single ray of light, as shown in the figure. Popular in long-distance situations spanning hundreds of kilometers, such as those required in long haul telephony and cable TV applications.
- Glass Core = 9 microns
- Glass Cladding= 125 microns
- Polymeric Coating = 1-3 microns

**Multimode fiber (MMF)**
Consists of a larger core and uses LED emitters to send light pulses. Specifically, light from an LED enters the multimode fiber at different angles, as shown in the next figure. Popular in LANs because they can be powered by low-cost LEDs. It provides bandwidth up to 10 Gb/s over link lengths of up to 550 meters.
- Glass Core = 50/62.5 microns
- Glass Cladding = 125 microns
- Polymeric Coating = 1-3 micron

## Connectors
An optical fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber. A variety of optical fiber connectors are available. The main differences among the types of connectors are dimensions and methods of coupling. Businesses decide on the types of connectors that will be used, based on their equipment.

For fiber standards with FX and SX in the name, light travels in one direction over optical fiber. Therefore, two fibers are required to support the full duplex operation. Fiber-optic patch cables bundle together two optical fiber cables and terminate them with a pair of standard single fiber connectors. Some fiber connectors accept both the transmitting and receiving fibers in a single connector known as a duplex connector, as shown in the Duplex Multimode LC Connector in the figure.

For fiber standards with BX in the name, light travels in both directions on a single strand of fiber. It does this through a process called Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM). WDM is a technology that separates the transmit and receive signals inside the fiber.

**Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors**
One of the first connector types used. The connector locks securely with a "twist-on/twist-off" bayonet style mechanism.

**Subscriber Connector (SC) Connectors**
Sometimes referred to as square connector or standard connector. It is a widely adopted LAN and WAN connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to ensure positive insertion. This connector type is used with multimode and single-mode fiber.

**Lucent Connector (LC) Simplex Connectors**
A smaller version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It is sometimes called a little or local connector and is quickly growing in popularity due to its smaller size.

**Duplex Multimode LC Connectors**
Similar to a LC simplex connector, but using a duplex connector. Click the button on each connector type for more information.

## Layers
### Jacket
Typically a PVC jacket that protects the fiber against abrasion, moisture, and other contaminants. This outer jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage.

### Strengthening Material
Surrounds the buffer, prevents the fiber cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. The material used is often the same material used to produce bulletproof vests.

### Buffer
Used to help shield the core and cladding from damage.

### Cladding
Made from slightly different chemicals than those used to create the core. It tends to act like a mirror by reflecting light back into the core of the fiber. This keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber.

### Core
the light transmission element at the center of the optical fiber. This core is typically silica or glass. Light pulses travel through the fiber core.

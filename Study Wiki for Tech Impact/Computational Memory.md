# RAM
You must be able to identify and install different RAM types. These questions will be scenario based.

### RAM Types
Random access memory (RAM) is the memory bank for data currently in use by a computer or device. RAM memory is temporary. There are numerous types of RAM.

#### Virtual RAM
Virtual RAM is space on a hard drive that can be allocated when additional memory is requested from an application. This space on the hard drive is also known as a **swap file** or a **paging file**.

#### Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)
Small outline dual inline memory modules are commonly found in laptops where space is at a premium and come in 100-, 144-, 200-, 204-, and 260-pin configurations. SODIMM defines the physical form factor of the module.

#### Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3)
DDR3 is **faster than DDR2** and has 30% **less power consumption**. It comes in 240-pin DIMM and 204-pin SODIMM. Double data rate (DDR), as the name implies, doubles the transfer rate of memory. DDR2 further increases the speed by two. DDR and DDR2 are legacy technologies and no longer used in modern devices.

#### Double Data Rate 4 (DDR4)
DDR4 is **faster than DDR3** and has **less power consumption**. It comes in 288-pin DIMM and 260-pin SODIMM.

#### Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5)
DDR5 **doubles the speed of DDR4** to 6.4 Gbps with improved power efficiency at 1.1 volts and is available in **up to 128 GB** modules.

#### Error-Correcting Code (ECC) RAM
Error-correcting code memory has **logic built in** to detect and correct single-bit memory errors. For each byte (eight bits) of memory, a parity bit is set that will allow the logic to detect and **correct an error in a single bit** of each byte. The logic would not correct an error in any byte with more than one bad bit.

### Single-Channel
Single-channel memory transfers data in chunks the same size as the system busâ€™s bandwidth.

### Dual-Channel
Dual-channel memory occurs when the memory controller **coordinates two memory banks** to work in conjunction with one another as a synchronized set when communicating with the CPU, doubling the size of the data transfer.

### Triple-Channel
Triple-channel memory **coordinates three memory modules** for communication with the CPU.

### Quad-Channel
Quad-channel memory **coordinates four memory modules** for communication with the CPU.

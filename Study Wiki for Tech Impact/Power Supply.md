The following describes the various computer desktop power supply form factors that have evolved over time:

- **Advanced Technology (AT)** – This is the original power supply for legacy computer systems now considered obsolete.
- **AT Extended (ATX)** – This is the updated version of the AT but still considered to be obsolete.
- **ATX12V** – This is the most common power supply on the market today. It includes a second motherboard connector to provide dedicated power to the CPU. There are several versions of ATX12V available.
- **EPS12V** – This was originally designed for network servers but is now commonly used in high-end desktop models.

### Voltage
The different connectors also provide different voltages. The most common voltages supplied are 3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts. The 3.3 volt and 5 volt supplies are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12 volt supply is used to run motors in disk drives and fans.

Power supplies can also be single rail, dual rail, or multi rail. A rail is the printed circuit board (PCB) inside the power supply to which the external cables are connected. A single rail has all of the connectors connected to the same PCB while a multi rail PCB has separate PCBs for each connector.

A computer can tolerate slight fluctuations in power, but a significant deviation can cause the power supply to fail.

#### Input 110-120 VAC vs. 220-240 VAC

The input to a power supply is provided by the power company. This is the power available at a wall outlet. In North America and some other parts of the world, **110 volts AC - 120 volts AC** is supplied. Other countries supply **220 volts AC - 240 volts AC**. So, power supplies are designed to accept either or both of these inputs. You may find power supplies that accept only one or the other voltage, but most accept both. Some have a switch to set for the correct input. Others accept either input without having to set a switch.

#### Output 3.3V vs. 5V vs. 12V

The power supply **converts the AC power input to DC power** that supplies the computer’s components. Most power supplies provide +5V and +12V. Others may also provide -12V, -5V, and +3.3V. You may see more than one connector for a specific output. For example, you may see two +12V outputs, each with its own connector. Each output is called a **rail**, so in this example, there would be two +12V rails.

### 20-Pin to 24-Pin Motherboard Adapter

Most power supplies provide DC output power on a standard 24-pin connector, also called the **ATX power connector**, which plugs into the motherboard. The connector is keyed so that it can only plug in one way, ensuring that the proper voltages are supplied to the right pins. Specific pins are designated to supply +5V, +12V, -12V, and 3.3V.

### Redundant Power Supply
A redundant power supply is a **secondary power supply** that provides power to a device in case of power failure.

### Modular Power Supply
A modular power supply is a power supply that is **not permanently attached** to the device. This provides the potential for additional power connections to the device.

### Wattage Rating
Wattage rating, or **power rating**, is the total capacity of the power supply. This must be high enough to meet the total power demands of all components in the computer. The number and **types of devices or components** in any given computer determine what wattage rating is needed for the power supply. They also determine what **types of connectors** are needed to ensure that you can connect the power supply to each device. The **type of case** the computer is in also needs to be considered to ensure that the power supply physically fits properly.

To determine the wattage requirement of the power supply, add all of the wattage ratings of the individual components. Your power supply’s wattage must meet or preferably exceed that total value. The connectors needed are determined by the connector types used on the devices to be powered. For example, if you have an older ATX motherboard, it has a 20-pin power connection, while newer models contain the 24-pin Molex power connection.

The power supply you select obviously must physically fit into the case. It also needs long enough cables from the power supply to reach the components.

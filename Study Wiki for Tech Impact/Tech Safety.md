# General
When you lift heavy computer towers, printers, servers and more, make sure that you bend your knees when you lift heavy objects to avoid injuring your back. Make sure that as we work inside of a computer case, that any sharp objects should be covered with tape. And while we work it's very important to wear safety goggles to prevent damage to your eyesight.
For your own safety, you should never open a power supply or a monitor that has a built-in power supply. 
 
# Electrical
Follow electrical safety guidelines to prevent electrical fires, injuries, and fatalities.

Some printer parts, such as power supplies, contain high voltage. Check the printer manual for the location of high-voltage components. Some components retain a high voltage even after the printer is turned off.

Electrical devices have certain power requirements. For example, AC adapters are manufactured for specific laptops. Exchanging AC adapters with a different type of laptop or device may cause damage to both the AC adapter and the laptop.

Electric equipment must be grounded. If a fault causes metal parts of the equipment to become live with electrical current, the ground will provide a path of least resistance for the current to flow harmlessly away. Typically computer product connect to ground via the power plug. Large equipment such as server racks that house network devices must also be grounded.

## ESD
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can occur when there is a buildup of an electric charge (static electricity) that exists on a surface which comes into contact with another, differently charged surface. ESD can cause damage to computer equipment if not discharged properly. Follow proper handling guidelines, be aware of environmental issues, and use equipment that stabilizes power to prevent equipment damage and data loss.

At least 3,000 volts of static electricity must build up before a person can feel ESD. For example, static electricity can build up on you as you walk across a carpeted floor. When you touch another person, you both receive a shock. If the discharge causes pain or makes a noise, the charge was probably above 10,000 volts. By comparison, less than 30 volts of static electricity can damage a computer component. Static buildup can be discharged by touching a grounded object prior to touching any electronic equipment. This is known as self-grounding

ESD can cause permanent damage to electrical components. Follow these recommendations to help prevent ESD damage:
- Keep all components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
- Use grounded mats on workbenches.
- Use grounded floor mats in work areas.
- Use antistatic wrist straps when working inside computers.
- Remove jewelry

# Fire
Guidelines in order to avoid cuts, burns, electrical shock and damage to your eyesight.
- remove any watches or jewelry and also secure our loose clothing
- turn off and unplug any equipment before we work on it. 
- keep food and drinks and any clutter out of our workspace.

As we work with electrical and dangerous components, you never know when something might catch fire. You should always know where the closest fire extinguisher is and also how to use it.
As we discuss fire safety, it's important that you remember to never fight a fire that is out of control or not contained. You should make sure you know how to get out of the building quickly that you are in. And don't forget to contact emergency services for help. Make sure you're prepared. You should locate and read instructions on any fire extinguisher near your workspace before you use them. Also you should make sure that the fire extinguisher is going to work.

Now a fire can spread very quickly and also be very costly. You should know the basics of using a fire extinguisher to prevent a small fire
from getting out of control.
The word you have to remember is pass. 
- P stands for pull the pin. 
- A stands for aim at the base of the fire. Not at the flames. 
- S stands for squeeze the lever. 
- S stands for sweep the nozzle from side to side.

You should be familiar with the different types of fire extinguishers. Some fire extinguishers, they're actually designed for paper, wood, plastics and cardboard. While others are designed for electrical equipment or even gasoline or combustible metals. This fire extinguisher here is rated for a couple items. It's rated for trash,wood and paper. It's rated for liquids, grease and it's rated for electrical.

### Extinguishers
Class A : dry fires, wood, 
Class B : liquid fires, gas and oil
Class C : electrical fires
